Brute force attacks and dictionary attacks are types of password cracking techniques used to gain unauthorized access to a system or network. Here's a detailed explanation of how they work and their limitations:

### Brute Force Attacks

A brute force attack involves trying all possible combinations of characters to crack a password. This is done by using a computer program that systematically tries different combinations of characters, such as letters, numbers, and special characters.

**How Brute Force Attacks Work:**

1.  The attacker uses a password cracking tool to generate a list of all possible combinations of characters.


Step 3: **Best Practices for Creating Strong, Unique Passwords:**

1. **Length**: Choose passwords that are at least 12 characters long. The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.
2. **Complexity**: Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This makes it harder for attackers to use brute-force methods.
3. **Uniqueness**: Use a different password for each account. Using the same password across multiple accounts increases the risk of a single breach affecting multiple accounts.
