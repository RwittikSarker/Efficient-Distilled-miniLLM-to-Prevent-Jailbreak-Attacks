"(For context):  $X$  is the random variable for number of successes ( $x$ ) out of  $n$  independent trials with probability of success  $p$  and probability of failure  $1-p = q$ 
 The formula for mass my book gives me for the binomial distribution is this:
 $P(X=x) = {n \choose x}p^xq^{n-x}$ 
 My question is this. How come order doesn't matter? Why do we use  ${n \choose x}$  in the above to calculate all the ways we can get  $x$  successes out of  $n$  independent trials instead of using  $nPx$ ? I.E. Why do we use combination instead of permutation? Can someone explain this to me because it's been really bothering me. 
 Thank You!

"For a given sequence  $\frac{n^2+k^2}{2n+1}$  where  $k$  is a given integer and  $k > 0$ , is there a way to calculate how many entries will be of integer value. Or, if that is not possible, know if it will ever be of integer value after a certain point.

"Let me first describe where I start:   
 $$\iint_Sz^2\,dS$$
We want to compute the surface integral of the octant of a sphere $S$. 
The radius = 1. 
The sphere is centered at the origin.   
 $$S=x^2+y^2+z^2=1.$$ 
 $$z=f(x,y)=\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$$
$R$ is the projection of $S$ on the $xy$-plane. 
 Now we compute the normalization factor used to project the integral on the $xy$-plane. First we compute the derivative  $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$: 
 If
$$m=1-x^2-y^2$$ 
and
$$n=\sqrt{m}\,,$$ 
then the derivative of $n$ is
$$n'=\frac12m^{-\frac12},$$ 
and the derivative of $m$ (with regard to $x$) equal to:
$$m'=-2x.$$   
 Now we can compute $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ using the chain rule:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=n'\cdot m'=\frac12m^{-\frac12}\cdot m'=\frac12(1-x^2-y^2)^{-\frac12}\cdot-2x=-{\frac{x}{\sqrt{(1-x^2-y^2)}}}.$$ 
Since $\sqrt{(1-x^2-y^2)}=z$:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=-{\frac xz}$$
And in the same manner (using the derivative of $m$ with regard to $y$) we can calculate $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=-{\frac yz}$$
Now we can calculate the normalization factor:
$$\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)^2}=\sqrt{1+\frac{x^2}{z^2}+\frac{y^2}{z^2}}=\frac1z\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}.$$
Since $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$:
$$\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)^2}=\frac1z$$ 
 Now we can calculate the projection $R$ of the sphere $S$ on the $xy$-plane:
$$\iint_Sz^2\,dS=\iint_R z^2\frac1z \,dx\,dy=\iint_R z\;dx\,dy.$$
Substituting for $z$ finishes the conversion of the surface integral (remember $z=f(x,y)=\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$):
$$\iint_Sz^2dS=\iint_R \sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}\;dx\,dy.$$ 
 This is where my problem starts : 
The book I'm reading says if we convert this to polar coordinates, the integration should be trivial. 
 So we convert to polar coordinates: 
$$x=r\cos\theta$$
$$y=r\sin\theta$$
$$z=f(x,y)=f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)$$
Calculate the Jacobian determinant: 
$$\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(r,\theta)}=\begin{vmatrix}\cos\theta & -r\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & r\cos\theta\\ \end{vmatrix}=r\cos^2\theta+r\sin^2\theta=r\,(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta)=r$$
Substitute:
$$\iint_Sz^2dS=\iint_R \sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}\;dx\,dy=\iint_T\sqrt{1-r^2\cos^2\theta-r^2\sin^2\theta}\cdot r \cdot dr\,d\theta$$
$$\iint_T\sqrt{1-r^2(\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta)}\cdot r \cdot dr\,d\theta = \iint_T\sqrt{1-r^2}\cdot r \cdot dr\,d\theta=\iint_T\sqrt{r^2-r^4}\cdot dr\,d\theta$$ 
 Since the radius $r=1$ it is easy to see that:
$$\int^1_0\sqrt{r^2-r^4}\cdot dr=\int^1_0(r^2-r^4)^{\frac12}\cdot dr = \int^1_0 \frac{(r^2-r^4)^{\frac32}}{\frac32}=0$$
 According to the book the result of the calculation of the surface of the sphere in the first octant should be $\pi/6$. 
That won't happen if $\int^1_0\sqrt{r^2-r^4}\cdot dr=0$.
The domain of $\theta$ is:
$$0\le\theta\le\frac12\pi$$
So where am I going wrong?

 Calculate all real solutions $x\in\mathbb{R}$ of the equation
  $$
\tag1(x^2-2x+2)^2-2(x^2-2x+2)+2 = x
$$ 
 
 My Attempt: 
 I used the concept of a composite function. Let $f(x) = x^2-2x+2$. Then equation $(1)$ converts into $f(f(x)) = x$. Both $f(x) = x$ and $f(x) = -x$ satisfy the given composite function. 
 Case 1:  If $f(x) = x$, then 
 $$
x^2-2x+2=x\\
x^2-3x+2=0\\
x\in\{1,2\}
$$ 
 Note that $1,2\in\mathbb{R}$. 
 Case 2:  If $f(x)=-x$, then 
 $$
x^2-2x+2=-x\\
x^2-x+2=0\\
x=\frac{1\pm \sqrt{1-8}}{2}\notin \mathbb{R}
$$ 
 So only $x\in\{1,2\}$ are the real solutions of above equation.

"There is a system of pipes from one point to another. Pipe A is the start point, and connects left to right to Pipe B, C & D, which are in parallel and connect to the end point. The pipes can flow if and only if there is a path A to the end point. In essence, pipe A must work and at least one of B, C & D must work. 
 The likelihood of any pipe being blocked in  $t$  amount of years is modelled by a  $\text{Exp}(3)$  distribution, and all pipes are blocked independently of one another. 
 I have been asked to find the mean time for the system to not work, and if it is known that the system is working, what is the probability that B is not blocked? 
 First, I would like to find an expression for the likelihood of this system working at time  $t$ , here is my working: 
 A, B & C are the event that these pipes are not blocked 
 $$\begin{align}
&\text{Let $Y$ be that the system works at a time $t$} \\
\therefore\quad\mathbb{P}(Y) &= 
\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) + \mathbb{P}(A \cap C) + \mathbb{P}(A \cap D) \\[1ex]&\text{Since all pipes block independently, and are identically distributed} \\
&= \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B) + \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(C) + \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(D) \\
&= 3\,\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B) \\[1ex]
&{\text{Since A & B are modeled by the remainder of}\\\text{ an exponential distribution with $\lambda$ = 3}} \\
&= 3\cdot(1-(1-e^{-3t}))^{2} \\
&= 3\cdot(e^{-3t})^{2} \\
&= 3e^{-6t}
\end{align}$$ 
 For the mean time to failure, I did the following calculation: 
 \begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(Y) = \int_{0}^{\infty} te^{-6t} dt = \frac{1}{36}
\end{align*} 
 Now, I am having difficulty understanding how to calculate  $\mathbb{P}(B \vert Y)$ 
 Here is my working so far, but I am almost certain it is wrong: 
 \begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(B \vert Y) &= \frac{\mathbb{P}(B \cap Y)}{\mathbb{P}(Y)} \\
\mathbb{P}(B \cap Y) &= \mathbb{P}(B \cap ((A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \cup (A \cap D)) \\
&= \mathbb{P}(A\cap B) + \mathbb{P}(B \cap A \cap C) + \mathbb{P}(B \cap A \cap D) \\
&= \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B) 
+ \mathbb{P}(B)\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(C)
+ \mathbb{P}(B)\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(D) \\
&= (e^{-3t})^{2} + (e^{-3t})^{3} + (e^{-3t})^{3} \\
&= e^{-6t} + 2e^{-9t} \\
&= e^{-6t}(1 + 2e^{-3t}) \\
\therefore \mathbb{P}(B \vert Y) &= \frac{e^{-6t}(1 + 2e^{-3t})}{3e^{-6t}}
= \frac{1 + 2e^{-3t}}{3}

If $u(x,y)$ is constant then $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=0$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=0$ therefore the riemann cauchy equations $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=-\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$ therefore $v(x,y)$ must also be constant which in turn means that f has to be constant, since $u(x,y),v(x,y)$ are constant

$$ E[u(x)] = E[u(\tilde{x} + \epsilon_x)] = E[-(\tilde{x} + \epsilon_x-g)^2] = E[-\tilde{x}^2 + 2\tilde{x}g-2\epsilon_x \tilde{x} - g^2 +2\epsilon_x g - \epsilon^2] = -\mu^2 + 2\mu g -g^2 -\sigma^2 = -(\mu - g)^2 -\sigma^2  $$    
 Approach 2 
 Let me shorten the notation here. $ f(x) $ stands for $ f_{a,b} (α,β,x) $. $ u(b) $ stands for $ u(x) \rvert_{x=b} $ Then:
$$ E[u (x)]= \int_a^b u(x) f(x) dx = u(b) - \int_a^b u'(x) F(x) dx = u(b) - u'(b) \int_a^b F(b) dx + u'(a) \int_a^b F(a) dx + \int_a^b u''(x) \int_a^b F(x) dx dx = u(b) - u'(b) \int_a^b 1 dx + u'(a) \int_a^b 0 dx + \int_a^b u''(x) \int_a^b \int_a^x f(t) dt dx dx = u(b) - u'(b) (b-a) + \int_a^b u''(x) \int_a^x (b-a) f(t) dt dx = u(b) - u'(b)(b-a) - 2(b-a) \int_a^b \int_a^x f(t) dt dx = u(b) - u'(b)(b-a) - 2(b-a)^2 F(x) = -(b-g)^2 + (b-g)(b-a) - 2(b-a)^2 F(x)$$

"In recent days, I have been studying:the properties of  $m^n+h\equiv0\pmod n$  where  $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$  and  $h\in\mathbb{Z}$ , and I am trying to calculate all solutions for  $2^n+1\equiv0\pmod n$  for all  $n\leq10^{15}$ . 
 Obviously, if one were to calculate the solutions by checking the numbers one by one, it would have taken an extremely long amount of time to do so. Therefore, I have tried to reduce the numbers needed to check by finding the divisibility patterns within the solutions. 
 From Proposition 3 of the paper ""Primitive solutions of  $n|2^n+1$ "", if  $n$  is not a power of  $3$  and  $n=3^kq$  where  $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ ,  $k\geq0$ ,  $k|2^k+1$  and  $q\neq1$ (In other words,  $3^k|n$  and  $n\neq3^k$ ), then  $q$  is also divisible by one of the primes  $p$  such that  $p|2^{3^k}+1$ . For example, if  $81|n$  and  $n\neq81$ , then one of { $243,1539,13203,7064091,10970073,22032887841$ } divides  $n$ . 
 However, I have also noticed that the same argument seems to be true for some other divisors. An example is that if  $171|n$  and  $n\neq171$ , then it seems that one of { $513,3249,97641,29884473,27439598619,3279345384337785847895810090688081$ } divides  $n$ . 
 Is it true for all divisors, and how can I prove it?

"Does there exist a definition for matrix exponentiation?
If we have, say, an integer, one can define  $A^B$  as follows:

 We can define exponentials of fractions as a power of a radical, and we even have the following definition of the exponential: 
 $$e^z = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!}$$ 
 which comes from a Taylor Series for the function  $\exp(z)$ . Now, a problem seems to arise when we attempt to calculate  $\exp(A)$ , where  $A$  is an  $n$  x  $n$  (square) matrix. We cannot define it as multiplication a ""matrix number of times"" as this makes no sense. The only reasonable definition that could work is the latter definition (the infinite series): 
 $$e^A = 1 + A + \frac{AA}{2!} + \frac{AAA}{3!} + \frac{AAAA}{4!} + \cdots$$ 
 where we can define matrix exponentiation to the power of an integer, which is all that is required here. We know that  $e^x$  will converge absolutely for all complex numbers, but do we know that this is true for matrices?
Can this ""matrix sum"" diverge, and are there ways to test divergence/convergence when a matrix is applied?
Or is this concept of ""matrix divergence"" not well defined?

 At first we assume that p is even. 
 First I define $$\xi_i=|B_{\frac{i+1}{n}}-B_{\frac{i}{n}}|^p$$ then we can get that $$E[\xi_i]=\left(\frac1n\right)^{\frac p2}(p-1)!!$$ and $$E[\xi_i^2]=\left(\frac1n\right)^{p}(2p-1)!!$$

"I'm struggling with applying my counting skills to probability problems. Specifically I'm grappling with how to enumerate the number of ways to draw colored balls from an urn in which we may have some balls different colors than others. 
 Here is an example. 
 Suppose we have $6$ red balls and $4$ blue balls and we want to know the number of ways to remove $4$ of them without replacement in order to calculate our sample space. The answer to me would be $10 \choose 4$. But it seems in most probability problems involving removing balls from urns the actual appropriate sample space would require us to ""label"" the colored balls so the actual sample space would be $10\cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7$.  
 If given a problem where we are removing balls from an urn and we are concerned with specific outcomes, for say the $n$th ball, is it necessary to view the balls within their own groups as labeled? That is, does the fact that we are removing balls and concerned with what balls gets removed when impose an ordering on our objects? 
 For instance, would it be better me to think of a probability question involving $6$ red balls and $4$ blue balls as the set $\{R,R,R,R,R,R,B,B,B,B\}$? Or the set $\{R_1,R_2,R_3,R_4,R_5,R_6,B_1,B_2,B_3,B_4\}$ where $R_i \neq R_j$ for $j\neq i$ and $B_i \neq B_j$ for $j\neq i$.

"Can we extend and generalise the ruler function by using only powers of $-1$ or other ""simple"" means, and then sum over the primes to efficiently test primality? 
 The ruler function (let's call it $r(n)$) is the exponent of the largest power of 2 that divides $n$:  $0,1,0,2,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,4,\ldots$ 
 A string of its values can easily be generated by beginning with the string $0$ and repeatedly appending to the end, the entire string incremented by 1. 
 This can be generalised to give the powers of any prime factor $p$ in any given integer $n$, by always appending the current string to itself $p-1$ times and incrementing the $(p-1)^{th}$ by 1.  For example the string for 3 is: 
 $0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,\ldots$ 
 The strings up to any given prime $p$ can be added, yielding a number which is accurate up to the $(p+1)^{th}$ prime in yielding a $1$ in the $n^{th}$ term if and only if $n$ is prime.  This fact would still be true if we replaced every nonzero number in the string with a $1$, although there may be benefit in retaining the full information.  Let's call this the simplified ruler $s$.  I thought it might be interesting to build a closed form for the primality of any given number by this means, and see if it simplifies to something useful. 
 Let's call the ruler function $r_2$ and generalise to $r_n$ although we are really interested in $r_p$ for any prime.  We can easily create the simplified ruler $s_2$ by raising $-1$ to powers of $n$ as follows: 
 $s_2(n)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{(-1)^n}{2}$ 
 Logic suggests we can do the same for the number 3.  Since $(-1)^n$ is binary for whole numbers, I suspect the method is to use a base 2 or binomial expansion of any given number, so calculate $s_3=s_4-s_1$ but I can't quite build it.  What does $s_3$ look like, and what is this function generalised for all $n$ or for all $p$? 
 By ""simple"" what I actually mean, is to create some function that is easy to work with and has some nice properties, I think I may be looking for  meromorphic  function, but please correct me.  But ideally I'd like to build it by powers of $-1$ or if necessary, complex numbers with unitary coefficients. 
 Can we also enhance this and build $r_p$? 
 Finally, does the sum across primes simplify in any way that gives us a powerful way of testing for nonzero values greater than some prime?  This prime testing identity holds for both the sum over all primes, and for the sum over all primes less than any given prime: 
 $$\mathbb{P}(x)=1\iff x\in prime$$ 
 holds for both: 
 $$\mathbb{P}(x)=\sum\limits_{k\in prime}^{\leq x}s_k(x)$$
and
$$\mathbb{P}(x)=\sum\limits_{k\in prime}s_k(x)$$ 
 In summary, just to make sure there can be no ""it is unclear what you are asking"", I'm asking if anybody can firstly generalise to $s_p$, the simplified ruler function $s_2$ and secondly sum $s_p(n)$ across either all primes, or all primes less than $n$. 
 I'm hoping this can be answered by the steps described, without just jumping directly to some statement like ""s is the dirichlet generating function for $s(n)$""!

 We have a fisherman who catches fish according to a Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 0.6$ fish per hour. The fisherman always fishes for at least $2$ hours. If during these $2$ hours he catches at least $1$ fish, he goes back home, else, he keeps fishing until he catches his first fish and then immediately leaves (we assume that he cannot catch $2$ fish at once, as per a Poisson process). 
 
 Q.  What is the expected number of caught fishes? 
 Let $X_t$ denote the Poisson (counting) process. I made two attempts. 
 
 Attempt 1 
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[\lim_{t \to +\infty} X_t - X_0\right] &= \mathbb{P}(X_2 = 0) \times \mathbb{E}\left[\lim_{t \to +\infty} X_t - X_0\mid X_2 = 0 \right] \\
&+ \mathbb{P}(X_2 > 0) \times \mathbb{E}\left[\lim_{t \to +\infty} X_t - X_0\mid X_2 > 0 \right]
\end{align*}
$$ 
 We know that if $X_2 = 0$, then the fisherman will catch only $1$ fish, and if $X_2 > 0$, then he will catch $X_2$ fish. So, we get
$$
\mathbb{P}(X_2 = 0) \times 1 + \mathbb{P}(X_2 > 0) \times \mathbb{E}\left[X_2 \right] \approx 0.3011942 + 0.8385669 = 1.139761
$$ 
 
 Attempt 2 
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[\lim_{t \to +\infty} X_t - X_0\right] &= \mathbb{E}\left[\lim_{t \to +\infty} ((X_t - X_2) + (X_2 - X_0)\right] \\
&= \mathbb{E}\left[X_2 - X_0\right] + \mathbb{E}\left[\lim_{t \to +\infty} X_t - X_2\right]
\end{align*}
$$ 
 Now, $\mathbb{E}\left[\lim_{t \to +\infty} X_t - X_2\right]$ is $1$ if and only if $X_2 = 0$, so $\mathbb{E}\left[\lim_{t \to +\infty} X_t - X_2\right] = \mathbb{P}(X_2 = 0)$. We calculate now
$$
1.2 + \mathbb{P}(X_2 = 0) \approx 1.2 + 0.3011942 = 1.501194
$$ 
 
 A quick simulation  suggests that attempt #2 is correct. However, I do not see why either of these attempts would be incorrect. Could anyone please shed some light?

"This is a question that I came across recently. 
 At the end of day  $0$ ,  $6$  magical seeds are planted. On each day following it, each seed has a chance to magically transform into an apple tree with a probability of  $\frac{1}{2}$ . The outcomes of seeds are independent of each another. 
 What is the expected number of days for all six seed to have become apple trees? 
 My solution: 
 $E(n)$  - number of expected days from the point that there is only n seed(s) left. 
So,  $E(1)$  - number of expected days for the last seed to grow. 
 $E(1) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} E(1) \,or \,E(1) = 2$ . This we anyway know from a coin flip analogy. 
 $E(2) = 1 + \frac{2}{4} E(1) + \frac{1}{4} E(2) \,or\, E(2) = \frac{8}{3}$ .
This comes from the fact that if at the end of a day, two seeds are left, I have 3 possible events - i) both seeds become trees the next day ( $+1$  day). ii) one seed becomes tree and one seed is left (probability  $\frac{2}{4}$ ). So we further add expected number of days for  $E(1)$ . iii) None of the seeds become a tree (probability  $\frac{1}{4}$ ). So we add further expected number of days for  $E(2)$ . 
 Similarly,  $E(3) = 1 + \frac{3}{8} E(1) + \frac{3}{8} E(2) +  \frac{1}{8} E(3)$ 
 $E(4) = 1 + \frac{4}{16} E(1) + \frac{6}{16} E(2) +  \frac{4}{16} E(3) + \frac{1}{16} E(4)$ 
 $E(4) = 1 + \frac{4}{16} E(1) + \frac{6}{16} E(2) +  \frac{4}{16} E(3) + \frac{1}{16} E(4)$ 
 $E(5) = 1 + \frac{5}{32} E(1) + \frac{10}{32} E(2) +  \frac{10}{32} E(3) + \frac{5}{32} E(4) + \frac{1}{32} E(5)$ 
 $E(6) = 1 + \frac{6}{64} E(1) + \frac{15}{64} E(2) +  \frac{20}{64} E(3) + \frac{15}{64} E(4) + \frac{6}{64} E(5) + \frac{1}{64} E(6)$ 
 This gives me an answer of  $E(6) = \frac{55160}{13671}$ . However the answer given is  $(\log_2 6)$ . I do not understand how the answer got into  $\log$ . When I calculate both, they are not same values. 
 Also, are there more generic and faster methods that I could use to get to the answer?

"Can you provide a proof of this identity using only calculus? 
 $$\ln x + 1 = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n+1}{n!} \cdot \frac{(\ln x)^n}{x}$$ 
 By the way, here is how I arrived at it: 
 There is string of length $x$ units. Select a point on the string uniformly at random and cut the string at that point. Repeat the process with the string on the left side of the cut until the string you have is shorter than $1$ unit. The problem is to figure out the expected number of cuts.  
 Here is how I did it:  
 Let $E(x)$ denote the expected number of cuts to be made on a string of length $x$. If $x<1$, clearly, $E(x)=0$. If $x>1$, we have: 
 \begin{align} E(x) &= 1 + \int_0^x E(u) \cdot \frac{du}{x} \\
                   &= 1 + \frac 1x \int_1^x E(u) \ du
\end{align}   
 Multiplying by $x$ and differentiating (applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus), 
 \begin{align} xE'(x) +  E(x) &= 1 + E(x) \\
   \Rightarrow E(x) &= \ln x + C \end{align} 
 Clearly for $x=1, \ E(x)=1$ thus $E(x) = \ln x + 1$ 
 However, we can also calculate $E(x)$ in a different way: 
 Let $P(n,\ x)$ denote the probability of exactly $n$ cuts being made on a string of length $x$. 
 If $x<1$, $P(n,\ x) = 0$; if $n=1$ and $x>1$ $P(n,\ x)=\frac 1x$; if $n>1$ and $x>1$: 
 \begin{align} P(n,\ x) &= \int_0^x P(n-1,\ u) \cdot \frac{du}{x} \\
                       &= \frac 1x \int_1^x P(n-1,\ u) \ du \end{align}    
 I calculated that $P(1,\ x) = \frac 1x,\ P(2,\ x) = \frac{\ln x}{x},\ P(3,\ x) = \frac{(\ln x)^2}{2x},\ P(4,\ x) = \frac{(\ln x)^3}{6x}$ 
 This led me to hypothesize that $P(n,\ x)=\frac{(\ln x)^{n-1}}{x(n-1)!}$, which can be proven by induction: 
 \begin{align} P(n,\ x) &= \frac 1x \int_1^x P(n-1,\ u) \ du \\
                       &= \frac 1x \int_1^x \frac{(\ln u)^{n-2}}{u(n-2)!} \ du \\                     &= \frac 1{x(n-2)!} \int_1^x (\ln u)^{n-2}\ d(\ln u) \\
                       &= \frac 1{x(n-2)!} \left[\frac {(\ln u)^{n-1}}{n-1}  \right]_1^x \\         &= \frac{(\ln x)^{n-1}}{x(n-1)!} \end{align} 
 But then $E(x)$ can be written as follows: 
 \begin{align} E(x) &= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n \cdot P(n,\ x)  \\ 
                   &= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n \cdot \frac{(\ln x)^{n-1}}{x(n-1)!} \\                 &=  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n+1}{n!} \cdot \frac{(\ln(x))^n}{x} 
\\ \\
\therefore \ \ln x + 1 &=  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n+1}{n!} \cdot \frac{(\ln(x))^n}{x} \ \blacksquare \end{align} 
 So can you prove this result by finding an appropriate Taylor series (this would be especially appreciated) or if not using Taylor series then using just the methods of calculus?

"I have several questions related to combinatorics. I am not a mathematician, and only understand the basics of $n \choose k$ (and commonly use Wolfram Alpha to solve such problems), maybe you can take this into account when answering. Thank you!  
 1) Imagine a disorder has 9 symptoms, and 5 are required for a diagnosis: that leads to 9 choose 5 (unordered, no repeats) symptom profiles that qualify for a diagnosis, correct?  
 2) Now imagine that these 9 symptoms are on 2 lists: list A has 2 symptoms, list B 7 symptoms. For a diagnosis, at least 1 symptom of list A, and at least 4 symptoms of list B have to be present. How many symptom profiles are there that qualify for the diagnosis?  
 3) It gets more complex. Symptom 2 is ""diminished interest or pleasure"". Interest and pleasure are different things, and I want to take that into account. So a person could have symptom 1, symptom 2a, symptom 2b, symptom 3, and so forth. That increases the number of possible symptom profiles: profile 2a 4 6 7 9 is distinct from 2b 4 6 7 9. How do I calculate that? 
 4) In fact, 6 of the 9 symptoms encompass 2 features (symptoms 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8). Unfortunately, I cannot simply increases the number of symptoms to make the calculation, because for example 1 4a 4b 6 7 would not qualify as symptom profile. Although there are 5 different symptoms present, 1 of the first list, 4 of the second list, 4a and 4b are handled as being the same symptom in the manual, and so this would not qualify. Neither would 1 4a 4b 5a 5b 7a 7b 8a 8b qualify - although the person has technically 9 symptoms, only 4 of them ""count"". How would one calculate the number of possible profiles in this case?  
 5) Lastly, let's move away from these 9 symptoms. Imagine you have a questionnaire with 21 questions. Each question asks: how much did you suffer from symptom x in the last 2 weeks? The scale is ordinal, from 0 (not at all) to 3 (a lot). Symptoms are simply added up to a sum-score, and my question is: how many symptom profiles exist using a certain threshold, e.g., 15? To put it differently, in how many different ways can you answer this questionnaire to achieve a sum-scores of 15 or more?

"I have a game that assigns the probability of finding items in treasure chests by making several independent checks until it fills a quota, with duplicates not allowed. I am trying to figure out how to calculate the resulting probabilities of finding each item - without breaking the bank in terms of calculation brute force. 
 For an example: The % chance of getting a small chest is 30. For a medium chest it's 15, and for a big chest it's 5. (There is no requirement that these add to 100.) 
 The algorithm: 
 
 Roll random against the large's 5%. 
 If successful, it's a large. If not, roll random against the medium's 15%. 
 If successful, it's a medium. If not, roll random against the small's 30%. 
 If successful, it's a small. If not, return to rolling for the large, and repeat the process indefinitely until  something  is successful. 
 
 This is then repeated over three layers. The layers are: 
 
 size of treasure chest 
 item category (e.g. weapon or armour) 
 specific item (e.g. for weapons: sword or pike; for armour: helmet, gloves, or boots) 
 
 So first the game makes this ""roll until success"" check to decide what chest to get. The chest selected determines which item pool is drawn from and how many items are needed. For each item needed, the game does a ""roll until success"" check for category, and then another for item. It repeats these two checks until it has the requisite number of items. Duplicates are not allowed; if an item would be a duplicate, the process is restarted. (Which I think is identical to changing the % chance of potential duplicates to 0.) 
 I am trying to, given the % chances for everything in all 3 layers, calculate the final probability that you will get a chest that has a specific item in it. I'm not looking for a one-time result of any particular example data: I'd like help in figuring out how to formulate the algorithm so I can apply it to any data. 
 This is giving me a headache for two reasons: 
 
 It's really close to being a geometric distribution, but because the ""success rate"" at each step is not identical, it isn't. Also you have to fudge the meaning of ""success"" because what item you get matters. 
 Ignoring duplicates is a pain. If item 2 is in a different category than item 1, there's no effect. But if item 2 is in the same category - or if one category has been completely exhausted - the rest of the things in that level all have different rates for item 2. 
 
 The brute force way of formulating this doesn't seem too hard (e.g. doing the  $(1-p)^k(p)$  thing for each p in order a bunch of times). But I don't want to use brute force, because I have to present the data  using MediaWiki , which  can  do this given the variable and loop extensions but I imagine doing this a ton will not be ideal - taking 2 items from a chest that has 4 categories and 3 things in each category looks like I need 21 iterations of  $(1-p)^k(p)$  (1 for ""chance of picking this"", 1 for each other option to get ""chance of picking this given I previously picked that""). If possible, I'm looking for something more pragmatic. 
 
 Other notes: 
 
 Some items can appear in more than one size of chest, with different rates. It should be easy enough to calculate them separately and proportionally add them together. 
 
 Related-looking questions: 
 
 Exhibit A  - Very similar, but no answer. 
 Exhibit B  - The same problem in essence (including the part where there's multiple levels of selection), but without the all-important ""repeat until something succeeds"" condition.

 I just know or rather heard that (though I don't know the proof)  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}=\frac{{\pi}^2}{6}$$  and (I calculated it)  $$16\displaystyle\int_0^\pi\int_0^1x^2\cdot\operatorname{sin}(y)\:\:dxdy=\frac{32}{3}$$  but I can't calculate the value of the expression written in the big brackets.

 Apples cost 0.5 each. you need 2 apples to reach the nearest dollar amount $1

"Calculate the integral  $\int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x}+1}{x+2}dx$ 
 What I have tried: 
 Split the integral

 $$=\int_0^{\infty}\frac{x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x}}{x+2}dx$$ 
 Taking the substitution
 $$u = x+2; du =dx; x= u-2$$ 
and with the change of variables 
 $$\implies \int_2^{\infty}\frac{(u-2)^{\alpha-1}e^{-u+2}}{u}du$$ 
 Then integrating by parts with the following substitutions
 $$z = (u-2)^{\alpha-1}; dx = (\alpha-2)(u-2)^{\alpha-2}du; dv = u^{-1}e^{-u+2}; v = e^2Ei(-u)$$ 
 $$\implies \int_2^{\infty}\frac{(u-2)^{\alpha-1}e^{-u+2}}{u}du=\left[(u-2)^{\alpha-1}e^2Ei(-u)\right]_2^{\infty}-(\alpha-1)e^2\int_2^{\infty}(u-2)^{\alpha-2}Ei(-u)du$$

 $$\int_0^1\frac{3x^3-2x}{(1+x)\sqrt{1-x}}K\left(\frac{2x}{1+x}\right)\,dx\stackrel ?=\frac\pi{5\sqrt2}$$ 
 
 The integral above comes from the evaluation of the integral $A=\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{f(\theta)}\pi d\theta$, where 
 $$f(\theta)=\int_0^\pi\frac{(3\sin^2\theta-2)\sin\theta\,d\phi}{\sqrt{2+2\sin\theta\cos\phi}}=\frac{\sqrt2(3\sin^2\theta-2)}{\csc\theta\sqrt{1+\sin\theta}}\int_0^{\pi/2}\left(1-\frac{2\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}\sin^2\gamma\right)^{-1/2}d\gamma,$$ 
 where $\gamma=\phi/2$, and the right side integral is $K\big(\!\frac{2\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}\!\big)$ by definition. After substitutions $x=\sin\theta$ and $y=\frac{2x}{1+x}$ we get 
 $$\begin{align}A&=\frac{\sqrt2}\pi\int_0^1\frac{3x^3-2x}{(1+x)\sqrt{1-x}}K\left(\frac{2x}{1+x}\right)\,dx\\

 where the integral has been numerically evaluated to suggest the analytic result on the right to several thousand digits. Is there any way to prove this equality, and are there any generalizations of this conjecture to include other parameters? 
 P.S.  Not that it's overly relevant to the question, but for the interested reader, the original integral comes from the following physics problem: 
 
 [Morin  Intro to Classical Mechanics , Ex. 10.12] The earth bulges slightly at the equator, due to the centrifugal force in the earth’s rotating frame. The goal of this exercise is to find the shape of the earth, first incorrectly, and then correctly. 
 (a) The common incorrect method is to assume that the gravitation force from the slightly nonspherical earth points toward the center, and to then calculate the equipotential surface (incorporating both the gravitational and centrifugal forces). Show that this method leads to a surface whose height (relative to a spherical earth of the same volume) is given by $h(\theta)=R\big(\!\frac{R\omega^2}{6g}\!\big)(3\sin^2⁡\theta-2)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle (the angle down from the north pole), and $R$ is the radius of the earth. 
 (b) The above method is incorrect, because the slight distortion of the earth causes the gravitational force to not point toward the center of the earth (except at the equator and the poles). This tilt in the force direction then changes the slope of the equipotential surface, and it turns out (although this is by no means obvious) that this effect is of the same order as the slope of the surface found in part (a). Your task: Assuming that the density of the earth is constant, and that the correct height takes the form of some constant factor $f$ times the result found in part (a), show that $f=5/2$. Do this by demanding that the potential at a pole equals the potential at the equator.

"I'm studying some linear algebra applications in quantum mechanics, and I was told that a normal matrix can be written as:

where $|\theta_i\rangle$ is the eigenvector associated with it's eigenvalue $\theta_i$. 
 The problem is that I can't properly visualize that summation as a normal matrix representation.

"1) Six children, Arya, Betsy, Chen, Daniel, Emily and Franco are to be seated in a single row of six chairs. If Betsy cannot sit next to Emily, how many different arrangements of the six children are possible? 
 So the total number of arrangements is 6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720 
 There are 5 ways that Betsy is to the left of Emily and there are 5 ways that Emily is to the left of Betsy. So there are 10 ways total that Emily and Betsy violate the question's parameters. So, for any of those 10 ways, the 4 remaining children can be seated in 4! ways: 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24. So you need to subtract 24 x 10 = 240 ways from the original total of 720. So the answer is 480. 
 Generally speaking, the method in this question is total combos - combinations that violate. 
 2) If a coin is flipped 5 times, what is the probability of exactly 3 heads? 
 So HHHTT is 1/32 but that's only 1 particular order. We also need to count HHTTH. We need to multiply 1/32 by the number of ways that we can get this outcome.  
 The formula for this problem is going to be 5! / (3!2!) = 10. 
We calculate the combinations this way because we need to divide out the indistinguishable outcomes from each other. For example H1H2H3T1T2 = H3H2H1T1T2 = H2H3H1T1T2 etc. Those 3 heads in the front can be arranged in 3! ways and so we need to divide out those from the total.  
 Anyway, the answer to this problem is 1/32 x 10 = 5/16.  
 So why the difference in approach? Why are we dividing out the combinations that are duplicates in question 2 but we're subtracting out the duplicates in question 1? I can't wrap my head around it! What's going on?

 So we find some remainder $r_{1}$ after division of  some  $a$ by  some  $b$, then we find some remainder $r_{2}$ after division of $a$ by $r_{1}$ and we repeat the procedure until we find such index $i$ that $r_{i} = 0$. 
 Therefore, let $$ M(a, b) = i-1$$ 
 for $a, b \in \mathbb{N}, b \neq 0 $
(I like to call it ""modulity of a by b"", thence  M ) 
 For our example: $M(27, 10) = 3$. 
 Notice that $M(a, b) = 0 \Leftrightarrow  b|a $ (this is why $i-1$ feels nicer to me than just $i$) 
 Recall what happens if we put a white pixel at such $(x, y)$ that $y|x$:
 
This is also the plot of $M(x, y) = 0$.
(the image is reflected over x and y axes for aesthetic reasons. $(0, 0)$ is exactly in the center) 
 What we see here is the common  divisor plot  that's already been studied extensively by prime number researchers. 
 Now here's where things start getting interesting: 
 What if we put a pixel at such $(x, y)$ that $M(x, y) = 1$?
 
Looks almost like the  divisor plot ... but get a closer look at the rays. It's like copies of the divisor plot are growing on each of the original line! 
 How about $M(x, y) = 2$?
 
Copies are growing on the copies!
Note that I do not overlay any of the images, I just follow this single equation. 
 Now here is my favorite.
Let us determine luminosity ($0 - 255$) of a pixel at $(x, y)$ by the following equation:
$$255 \over{ M(x,y) + 1 }$$
(it is therefore full white whenever $y$ divides $x$, half-white if $M(x, y) = 1$ and so on)

 What strikes me the most is that some black stripes appear in the gray area and they most often represent prime number locations.

 The above plot considering only prime $x$: 
 
 Formula: $255 \over{ M(p_{x},y) }$ (note I do not add $1$ to the denominator because it would be full white only at $y$ equal $1$ or the prime. Therefore, the pixel is fully white when $p_{x}$ mod $y = 1$ )

 Interestingly, these modulities form a divisor plot of their own.  
 Notice that for $ M(a, b) = i-1, r_{i-1}$ results in either $1$ or a divisor of $a$ (which is neither $1$ nor $a$). 
 I put a white pixel at such $(x, y)$ that for $M(x, y) = i - 1$, it is true that $r_{i-1}\neq 1 \wedge r_{i-1} | x$ (the one before last iteration results in a remainder that divides $x$ and is not $1$ (the uninteresting case)) 
 http://i.imgur.com/I85rlH5.png 
 It is worth our notice that growth of $M(a, b)$ is rather slow and so if we could discover a rule by which to describe a suitable $b$ that most often leads to encountering a proper factor of $a$, we would discover a primality test that works really fast (it'd be $O(M(a, b))$ because we'd just need to calculate this $r_{i-1}$). 
 Think of $M'(a, b)$ as a function that does not calculate $a$ mod $b$ but instead does $M(a, b)$ until a zero is found.
These two are plots of $M'''(x, y)$ with and without primes marked:

 For comparison, plot of $x$ mod $11$ (1:1 scale): 
 http://i.imgur.com/KM6SCF3.png 
 As it's been pointed out in the comments, subsequent iterations of $M(a, b)$ look very much like  Euclidean algorithm  for finding the greatest common divisors using repeated modulo. A strikingly similar result can be obtained if for $(x, y)$ we plot the number of steps of $gcd(x, y)$:  
 
 I've also found similar picture  on wikipedia :
 
 This is basically the plot of algorithmic efficiency of $gcd$. 
 Somebody even drew a  density plot here on stackexchange . 
 The primes, however, are not so clearly visible in GCD plots . Overall, they seem more orderly and  stripes do not align vertically  like they do when we use $M(a, b)$ instead. 
 Here's a convenient comparative animation between  GCD timer  (complexity plot) and my Modulity function ($M(x, y)$). Best viewed in 1:1 zoom. $M(x, y)$  appears to be different in nature from Euclid's GCD algorithm. 
 
 
 Questions 
 
 Where is $M(a, b)$ used in mathematics?  
 Is it already named somehow? 
 How could one estimate growth of $M(a, b)$ with relation to both $a$ and $b$, or with just $a$ increasing? 
 What interesting properties could $M(a, b)$ possibly have and could it be of any significance to number theory?

"I would like to find a general solution to the integral:
 $$I(s,t,k)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(tx)}{x^2+k^2}e^{-sx}dx$$ 
so far using the substitution  $u=\frac xk$  I have managed to reduce this to:
 $$I(s,t,k)=\frac 1k\int_0^\infty\frac{\cos(tku)}{u^2+1}e^{-sku}du$$ 
and then by defining  $\alpha=tk,\beta=sk$  we can come up with a simpler integral:
 $$J(\alpha,\beta)=\int_0^\infty\frac{\cos(\alpha u)}{u^2+1}e^{-\beta u}du$$ 
 
 We can calculate that:
 $$J_{\beta\beta}=\int_0^\infty\frac{u^2\cos(\alpha u)}{u^2+1}e^{-\beta u}du$$ 
 $$=\int_0^\infty\cos(\alpha u)e^{-\beta u}du-J$$ 
 $$=\frac{\beta}{\beta^2+\alpha^2}-J$$ 
 $$J_{\alpha\alpha}=-J_{\beta\beta}$$ 
 
 We now know that:  $\nabla^2J=0$ 
 Now to form a system of equations I found that:
 $$J(0,0)=\frac \pi2$$ 
 $$J(\alpha,0)=\frac{\pi}{2}e^{-\alpha}$$ 
However I am struggling to find a solution to  $J(0,\beta)$  although I know that it satisfies the equation:
 $$K''(\beta)+K(\beta)=\frac 1\beta,K(0)=\frac \pi2$$ 
It seems clear to me that  $\lim_{\beta\to\infty}J(\alpha,\beta)=0$ 
so if I could solve for  $K$  I should have everything I need to try and solve this problem. 
 
 I think its obvious but I should add that:
 $$I(s,t,k)=\frac 1kJ(tk,sk)$$ 
 Basically, could anyone help me find  $J(0,\beta)$  or proceed with solving the pde I stated. Thanks!

"This may end up being a question more about scientific best practice than anything else, but I think this is the right community to ask it in to get the insight I'm looking for. 
 
 Say I have two little square widgets made out of a material that shrinks when it gets wet.  I want to know by how much.  I measure the length of the widgets along two lines each (because they're not shaped perfectly and my measurement technique isn't perfect), before and after soaking them with water.  I come back with data that looks like this: 
 Widget  Measurement  Before  After  Shrinkage
1       1            1.898   1.722  0.176
1       2            1.904   1.737  0.167
2       1            2.003   1.763  0.240
2       2            2.029   1.843  0.186
 
 Now, I can calculate the overall mean without worrying too much in this case, since the mean of two means is the same as the mean of all the points that went in as long as each mean has the same number of samples, which in this case they do.  So: 
 avg(0.176,0.167,0.240,0.186) = 0.192 = avg(avg(0.176,0.167),avg(0.240,0.186))
 
 However, this type of relation is  not  true for the standard deviation.  There are several approaches that immediately present themselves to me as options for finding an overall standard deviation for this dataset: 
 
 Use all of the data at once:  sd(0.176,0.167,0.240,0.186) = 0.033 
 Get a standard deviation for each widget, and average them:  avg(sd(0.176,0.167),sd(0.240,0.186)) = 0.022 
 Get the average for each widget, and take the standard deviation of the two:  sd(avg(0.176,0.167),avg(0.240,0.186)) = 0.029 
 
 Now, maybe it's just confusion on my part as to the meaning of a standard deviation, but I don't know which approach would be correct to use here (for the purpose of, for example, putting error bars on a graph).  Intuitively I'm drawn to the first method, because it seems to incorporate the most information about the data in the actual standard deviation calculation.  I'm wary, though, that doing this could be be implicitly making some assumption about the structure of the data, such as  homogeneity , which may not actually hold. 
 What approach is generally regarded as  correct , and what assumptions about the structure of the data does it imply?  Is there another, more correct method (or another method that makes fewer assumptions) which I failed to list?

I need to find value $f^{-1}(12)$ of inverse function of 
$f(x)=5+x+\ln(x-6)$ 
 Whatever I tried, I did not go far. Finally I found out about Lambert W function. We have never mentioned it at school, or I was sick that day :-P. 
This is what I did. 
 First subtract $11$ from both sides: 
 $$y=5+x+\ln(x-6)$$ 
 $$y-11=x-6+\ln(x-6)$$ 
 substitute:  
 $$x-6=Z$$ 
 $$y-11=Z+\ln Z$$ 
 exp: 
 $e^{y-11}=Z e^Z$  Lambert $W$ function: 
 $$Z=W(e^{y-11})$$ 
 then I bring back subs: 
 $$x-6=W(e^{y-11})$$ 
 $$x=6+W(e^{y-11})$$ 
 Now, if I substitute y with 12, I get  
 $$x=6+W(e)$$ 
 I also found a way how to calculate this in Python and got two values for $W(e)$:
$1.76322281532$ and 
1.76322284514

"I am having troubles understanding how to calculate the n-th root of a negative number. 
 To explain what exactly I am struggling with, let me demonstrate my thought process alongside the calculation of the n-th root of a positive number (in  $\mathbb{C}$ ), for example 
 $$\tilde{z}^4 = 2 \implies \tilde{z} = \sqrt[4]{2}, \text{ where } \tilde{z} \in \mathbb{C}$$ 
 To my understanding, this can be solved by the following formula, among others: 
 $$\sqrt[n]{z} = \sqrt[n]{r} \times e^{i\frac{\phi + 2k\pi}{n}}, k \in \{ 0, 1, ..., n-1 \}$$ 
 where  $r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$  and  $\phi = \arctan \frac{b}{a}$ . Given the equation from above, this gives 
 $$\sqrt[4]{2} = \sqrt[4]{2} \times e^{i\frac{k\pi}{2}}, k \in \{ 0, 1, ..., n-1 \}$$ 
 since  $a = 2, b = 0 \implies r = \sqrt{2^2 + 0^2} = 2, \phi = \arctan \frac{0}{2} = 0$ . This results in 
 $$z = \left\{ \sqrt[4]{2},  \sqrt[4]{2} \times e^{\frac{i\pi}{2}}, \sqrt[4]{2} \times e^{-\frac{i\pi}{2}} , -\sqrt[4]{2} \right\} $$  which is correct. 
 However, this approach seemingly fails for negative numbers  $z$ , as this would produce the same (now obviously wrong) results. I have found that for negative numbers, the result is correct if  $\phi = \pi$ , but either way there is a mistake in my thinking when applying the above formula to negative numbers, and I need help figuring out where exactly I am going wrong. 
 This is not necessarily related to the main question asked, but what would happen if I were to take the n-th root of a purely imaginary number (or rather, a number  $k \in \mathbb{C}, \text{where } \mathfrak{R}(k) = 0$ ), as this would lead to  $\phi = \arctan \frac{b}{0}$ .

 $$P(A) = p(1) = q$$ 
 with  $q$  unknown.  The solution above seems to suggest that P(A) is 0.75 regardless of the value of  $q$ .  How can I reconcile these differences?  By extension, how do I calculate  $P(n)$  regardless of the outcome of the first  $n-1$  tosses?

"When we use change of variables for integration, we are required to also multiply the integrand by a scaling factor: 
 For change of coordinates with double integrals, the scaling factor is found by $dxdy = \left| \det \left( \dfrac{\partial g(u,v)}{\partial(u,v)} \right) \right| dudv$. 
 For change of coordinates with triple integrals, the scaling factor is found by $dxdydz = \left| \det \left( \dfrac{\partial g(u,v,w)}{\partial(u,v,w)} \right) \right| dudvdw$. 
 For change of coordinates with polar coordinates, the scaling factor is found by $\left| \det \left( \dfrac{\partial g(\rho, \theta)}{\partial(\rho, \theta)} \right) \right| = \rho$. 
 For change of coordinates with cylindrical coordinates, the scaling factor is also $\rho$. 
 For change of coordinates with spherical coordinates, there scaling factor is found by $\left| \det \left( \dfrac{\partial g(r, \theta, \phi)}{\partial(r, \theta, \phi)} \right) \right| = r^2\sin(\phi)$. 
 These scaling factors are used when using change of coordinates to calculate the area or volume of an object. 
 However, when we parameterise surfaces, such as when finding the area of a surface $\left( \iint_S \left| \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial u} \times  \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial v} \right| dudv \right)$ or calculating a surface integral $\left( \iint_S f(g(u, v)) \cdot \left| \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial u} \times  \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial v} \right| dudv \right)$, we do not utilise a scaling factor; instead, we just parameterise and apply the relevant formulae. I can parameterise a surface using cylindrical coordinates or spherical coordinates, but unlike when using change of variables to integrate an object for volume, I do not need to multiply the integrand by a scaling factor.  
 One would assume that a scaling factor would be required in both cases, since they both involve converting from one coordinate system to another. Why is this not the case? The only reason I can think of is that the scaling factor is already implicitly imbedded in our formulae, since, similarly to the formulae used to find the scaling factors, we are taking the determinant of the partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate when we use the cross product $\left( \iint_S \left| \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial u} \times  \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial v} \right| dudv, \iint_S f(g(u, v)) \cdot \left| \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial u} \times  \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial v} \right| dudv \right)$. Is my hypothesis correct? Or is there another reason for this? 
 I would greatly appreciate it if people could please take the time to clarify this.

"I'm trying to draw the bio-hazard symbol for  a codegolf challenge  in Java, for which I've been given the following picture (later referred to as unit diagram): 
 
 Most existing answers in other programming languages use an approach involving a loop of 3, in which they rotate by 120 degrees and draw the circle again. In Java however, drawing each shape one by one from a fixed position would be shorter (and the shorter the better in  code-golf  challenges). 
I want to draw the shapes in the following order: 
 
 Three big circles in black 
 Three inner circles in white 
 The small center circle in white 
 The three gaps at the center in white 
 The three gaps at the outer parts in white 
 A black ring in the middle, with three white rings along the circles we've drawn in step 2; which will create three arcs 
 
 I won't go too deep into detail of what each Java method does, but in general, most of the methods are given an  $x,y$ -coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle surrounding the oval, and a  $width$  and  $height$ . Because of this, I want to calculate all  $x,y$ -coordinates of the circle given the unit diagram, while I only assume the coordinates of the very center of the screen. 
 Here a more visual representation of the steps and what I want to calculate (quickly made in paint, so excuse any inaccuracies): 
 
 So to use the Java methods, I need to know the  $x,y$ -coordinates of all red dots; the width/height of the purple lines; and the angles of the blue lines (for the arcs of step 6). 
 Assumption: the pink dot at the very center is at  $x,y$ -position  $[300,300]$ ; and the units in the first picture are multiplied by 10 for my output. 
 Here the ones I've been able to figure out myself thus far: 
 
 Width/height (purple line): This is  $H$  in the unit diagram, thus  $300$ .
 
 The first  $x,y$ -coordinate (first red dot): we know that from the very center of the screen (pink dot) to the center of the large circles (yellow dot) is unit  $E=110$  (green line). The yellow dot therefore is at position  $[300, 300-E] → [300,190]$ . From there, we can subtract halve of  $H$  from both the  $x$  and  $y$  positions to get to coordinates of the red dot:  $[300-\frac{H}{2}, 300-E-\frac{H}{2}] → [150,40]$ . 
 The second  $x,y$ -coordinate (second red dot):  $\color{red}?$ 
 The third  $x,y$ -coordinate (third red dot):  $\color{red}?$ 
 
 
 Width/height (purple line): This is  $G$  in the unit diagram, thus  $210$ .
 
 The first  $x,y$ -coordinate (first red dot):  $\color{red}?$ 
 The second  $x,y$ -coordinate (second red dot):  $\color{red}?$ 
 The third  $x,y$ -coordinate (third red dot):  $\color{red}?$ 
 
 
 Width/height (purple line): This is  $D$  in the unit diagram, thus  $60$ .
 
 $x,y$ -coordinate (red dot): This is the position of the pink dot, minus halve its width/height for both the  $x$  and  $y$  coordinates:  $[300-\frac{D}{2}, 300-\frac{D}{2}] → [270,270]$ . 
 
 
 Width/height (purple lines): The width is  $A$  in the unit diagram, thus  $10$ . The height doesn't really matter in this case, as long as it's large enough to create the entire gap, but also not too large. Although it doesn't reflect my paint drawing, we could for example use  $D$  as height and draw up to the pink dot.
 
 The first  $x,y$ -coordinate (first red dot): Assuming the height is  $D$  and we draw up to the pink dot, we know the  $x,y$  coordinate is at position  $[300-\frac{A}{2}, 300-D] → [295,240]$ . 
 The second/third/fourth/fifth  $x,y$ -coordinates / red dots (the Java method to draw irregular oriented rectangles requires all four  $x,y$ -coordinates of the corners):  $\color{red}?$ 
 The sixth/seventh/eight/ninth  $x,y$ -coordinates / red dots (the Java method to draw irregular oriented rectangles requires all four  $x,y$ -coordinates of the corners):  $\color{red}?$ 
 
 
 Width/height (purple lines): The width is  $C$  in the unit diagram, thus  $40$ . The height is just like with step 4 not really important, so let's just use twice the  $x$  coordinate of the very top, which we've calculated in step 1.1 and was  $40$ , so we'll use a height of  $80$  here.
 
 The first  $x,y$ -coordinate (first red dot): Assuming the height  $80$  and we draw from  $y=0$ , we know the  $x,y$ -coordinate is at position  $[300-\frac{C}{2}, 0] → [280,0]$ . 
 The second/third/fourth/fifth  $x,y$ -coordinates / red dots (the Java method to draw irregular oriented rectangles requires all four  $x,y$ -coordinates of the corners):  $\color{red}?$ 
 The sixth/seventh/eight/ninth  $x,y$ -coordinates / red dots (the Java method to draw irregular oriented rectangles requires all four  $x,y$ -coordinates of the corners):  $\color{red}?$ 
 
 
 Width/height (purple line): Unlike the other circles, the height of the circle along which the ring is drawn isn't known in the unit diagram. We know the thickness of the ring (orange line) is  $B=35$ . In the unit diagram we also see that from the very center (pink dot) to the center of the circles we've drawn in step 1, the unit is  $E=110$ . And from the center of this circle of step 1 to the bottom of the arc is unit  $A=10$ . We can therefore deduct that the width/height (purple line) is  $2(E-A+B)→270$ .
 
 The  $x,y$ -coordinate (red dot): Since we know the circle is in the center and we also know it's width/height, we can easily calculate the  $x,y$ -coordinate as:  $[300-(E-A+B), 300-(E-A+B)] → [165,165]$ . 
 We also know the thickness of the last three white rings we draw on top is  $A=10$ , and their width/height and  $x,y$ -coordinates are the exact same as the three circles we've drawn in step 2. 
 
 
 
 Can anyone help me determine the  $\color{red}?$  above. Thus the unknown  $x,y$  coordinates in the steps 1, 2, 4 and 5? Just general information on how I could go about calculating these is fine as well, but right now I don't know where to even begin. Also, sorry if asking all steps at once is too much for a single question. I could split it up into the unknowns of each individual step in separated questions if that's preferable.

"I am trying to calculate the probability of picking perfect squares out of first  $n$  positive integers. 
 There are  $\operatorname{floor}(\sqrt n)$  number of perfect squares less than  $n$ , if we assume picking each number is equally likely then probability of picking perfect squares less than  $n$  is  $p(n) =\operatorname {floor}(\sqrt n) /n$ 
 But if we consider all positive integers then ( I think but I am not sure) the probability is  $\lim_{n\to \infty} p(n) = 0$ .

 If for a set $S= \lbrace 1 , 2 \rbrace$ the set $T = \lbrace (1,2),(2,1) \rbrace$ is refered to as a  permutation , 
 then how would an alternative set $U = \lbrace (1),(2),(1,2),(2,1) \rbrace$ be refered to with respect to $S$? 
 Background 
 The background is that it is easy for any set $S_n = \lbrace 1,2, \dots n \rbrace$ with $|S_n|=n$,  to calculate number of elements in $T_n$ as being $n!$.  
 Getting the number of elements in a set $U_n =  \lbrace (1),(2),(1,2),(2,1),\dots (n,n-1,\cdots,1,2),(n,n-1,\cdots,2,1) \rbrace$ 
that is being constructed in a similar fashion as the $U$ above for the case of $|S|=2$, but for $S$ having $n$ elements gives me trouble. 
 helpful would be 
 to know a  more correct term  to describe/refer the kind of set $U_n$.  
 I think it is incorrect to say that $U_n$ is merely another type of permutation, as for instance the elements of $U_n$ are tuples of varying degree. 
 Does permutation require that the image set would consist solely of a single type of n-tuple ?

 First of all assuming  $p_0$  is some point s.t each sphere can be represented as a function  $z_1, z_2 : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$  in a neighborhood of  $p_0$  (if it isn't we can use another variable), what I think we want to show is that the tangant spaces to  $z_1, z_2$  are orthogonal at this point, i.e  $\langle\nabla z_1(p_0), \nabla z_2(p_0)\rangle=0.$  But when I calculate this I get that it does not equal 0: 
 $z_1 = \sqrt{2ax-x^2-y^2}, z_2 = \sqrt{2by-x^2-y^2}$ 
 $\nabla z_1 = (\frac{2a-2x}{2 \sqrt{2ax-x^2-y^2}}, \frac{-2y}{2 \sqrt{2ax-x^2-y^2}})$

 60% of new drivers in a particular country have had additional driving education. During their first year of driving, new drivers who have $\mathit{not}$ had additional driving education have a probability of 0.12 of having an accident, while new drivers who $\mathit{have}$ had additional driving instruction have a probability of 0.03 of having an accident. Calculate the probability that a new driver does not have an accident during their first year of driving. 
 
 My thoughts are thus; 
 Let $N_e$ be the event that a new driver has had additional instruction and $N_n$ be the event that the driver has $\mathit{not}$ had additional instruction and let $A$ be the event that a driver has an accident. Then, 
 $$P(A|N_n) = 0.12$$
and
$$P(A|N_e) = 0.03.$$ 
 Then the total probability of having an accident is 
 $$P(A|N_e) + P(A|N_n) = 0.15.$$ 
 As such, the probability of a new driver $\mathit{not}$ having an accident is the compliment of this. That is, 
 $$P(A^c) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.$$

"Assume that  $X,Y$  are two independent exponential random variables with mean  $\lambda$ . How can I calculate the probability density function of  $W=\frac{Y}{\max(X,Y)}$ ? 
 I know how to calculate the probability density function or  $\max(X,Y)$  of  $\min(X,Y)$ , which has been asked before here many times. But when I wanted to use the same way for this, I got confuses at the beginning. 
 Is it a good way to condition on  $X\geq Y$ ?

"We can assign a framing to a knot $K$ (in some nice enough space $M$) in order to calculate the self-linking number $lk(K,K)$. But of course it is not necessarily canonical, as added twists in your vector field can remove/add crossings.  
 Two things are stated in Witten's QFT paper on the Jones polynomial, which I do not quite see: 
 1)  On $S^3$ we do have a canonical framing of knots, by requesting that $lk(K,K)=0$. 
Why? I must be understanding this incorrectly, because if we decide the framing by requiring $lk(K,K)=0$, so that the framing has whatever twists it needs to accomplish this, then aren't we making a choice?? We could have simply required $lk(K,K)=n$ for any integer $n$. If $n> 0$ does there then exist multiple possible framings? 
 2)  For general 3-manifolds, we can have $lk(K,K)$ ill-defined or it can be a fixed fraction (modulo $\mathbb{Z}$) so that any choice of framing won't make it $0$. 
What are some examples? When is it possible to set a fixed fraction? Is there a relation between the 3-manifold $M$ and the fractional value you can assign to $lk(K,K)$?

 So, calculate the symmetric parts of $C$ and $D$, see if they're positive-definite, easy enough. However, not knowing the data of $B$ (besides its properties) doesn't allow me to calculate the symmetric part of $A$, so I need to work by properties only. What am I not seeing here?

"I'm reading Richard Ryan's article ""A Simpler Dense Proof regarding the Abundancy Index"" and got stuck in his proof for Theorem 2. The Theorem is stated as follows: 
 Suppose we have a fraction of the form  $\frac{2n-1}{n}$ , where  $2n-1$  is prime. 
 (i) ... 
 (ii) If  $n$  is odd and  $I(b)=\frac{2n-1}{n}$  for some  $b$ , then  $b$  is odd; moreover, if  $2n-1$  does not divide  $b$ , then  $b(2n-1)$  is a perfect number. 
 Ryan's proof: Suppose that  $n$  is odd and  $b$  is even. Let  $m$  be the greatest integer such that  $2^m$  divides  $b$ . Once again, there is a prime factor,  $q$ , of  $\sigma(2^m)$  that divides  $b$ . Thus  $I(b) > I(2^mq) > 2$  and we have a contradiction. Finally, if the prime number  $2n - 1$  does not divide  $b$  then, since  $I$  is multiplicative,  $I(b(2n - 1)) = 2$ . 
 The 'once again' comes from (i): ... let  $I(b)=\frac{2n-1}{n}$  for even  $b$  and  $m$  be the greatest integer such that  $2^m$  divides  $b$ . There is a prime factor,  $q$ , of  $\sigma(2^m)$  that
also divides  $b$  since  $\sigma(2^m) = 2^{m+1} - 1 \neq 2n - 1$ . Thus 
 $I(b) > I(2^mq) \geq \frac{2^{m+1}-1}{2^m}\cdot\frac{2^{m+1}}{2^{m+1}-1}=2$ , 
 which contradicts  $I(b)=\frac{2n-1}{n}$ . 
 I see that  $\sigma(2^m)=2^{m+1}-1\neq 2n-1$ , because  $n$  is odd and thus  $2n$  is not a power of two. It is also possible to easily calculate, that  $b\neq2^m$  so  $b$  must have some other factor in addition to  $2^m$  and that factor has a prime factor,  $p$ , for which  $2^mp$  divides  $b$ . But Ryan writes that  $\sigma(2^m)$  must have the prime factor  $q$  and arrives at a contradiction through that. Could someone explain this to me? Also, I don't understand how  $I(q)\geq\frac{2^{m+1}}{2^{m+1}-1}$ 
 EDIT: As Jose pointed out, the answer below is incorrect. I think I made some progress in the right direction below. 
 $I(b)=\frac{\sigma(b)}{b}=\frac{2n-1}{n}\implies n\sigma(b)=b(2n-1)\implies n\sigma(2^m)\sigma(a)=b(2n-1)$ , because  $b$  is even but not a power of two. Now  $\sigma(2^m)=2^{m+1}-1\neq2n-1$  from Ryan's proof makes sense:  $\sigma(2^m)$  divides b so it must have the prime factor  $q$ , which divides  $b$ . Thus 
 $I(b)>I(2^mq)=\frac{2^{m+1}-1}{2^m}\cdot\frac{q+1}{q}$ . However, I still do not understand how  $I(q)=\frac{\sigma(q)}{q}=\frac{q+1}{q}\geq\frac{2^{m+1}}{2^{m+1}-1}$ . 
 Abundancy Index  $I$  is defined as  $I(n)=\frac{\sigma(n)}{n}$ , where  $\sigma$  counts the sum of divisors. Both  $I$  and  $\sigma$  are multiplicative. 
 EDIT: There's no tag for Abundancy Index.

"I'm having a little trouble with an exercise, due to a flawed logic that I need to fix. I apologize in advance if anything of this is silly, or for my language as I'm not a native English speaker. 
 I have an alphabet of 21 letters and 10 digits (0-9) and I need to calculate the probability of creating a password that has a total length of 8 characters, with exactly 2 digits and 6 letters. 
 First, I defined the total of outcomes, which are $31^8$: I've imagined 8 boxes, each one can have 31 (the total length of the alphabet) possible characters. 
 Now, for the likely outcomes  I've imagined to calculate all the ways to take 2 digits out of 10  ($\binom{10}{2}$)  and multiply them for the possible ways to take 6 letters from 21 total letters ($\binom{21}{6}$). I thought of combinations because no order is apparently required. 
 The solution is different on these outcomes: I was right on $31^8$ but the likely outcomes are calculated as $\binom{8}{2}*10^2*21^6$ for a result of
$P(E) = \frac{\binom{8}{2}*10^2*21^6}{31^8}$. 
 I can't understand this solution, nor what I'm doing wrong. Can anybody help me out?

Now the indefinite integral of the integral above:

which I have to calculate, so I could calculate the definite integral, is correct. I checked it on Wolfram Alpha. However Wolfram is also telling me that the value of the my definite integral is around: 0.07972. And that's the problem. More below. 
 Here is the indefinite integral, modified so I can just put the values 13 and  $\infty$  in and get the result:
 $$\lim_{x\to \infty}\left(\arctan(x)+\ln(x)-\frac{1}{2}\ln(x^2+1)\right)-\left(\arctan(13)+\ln(13)-\frac{1}{2}\ln(13^2+1)\right)$$

 $$\ln(\infty) - \frac{1}{2}\ln(\infty^2+1)=\infty - \infty.$$

 Question 
 I was trying to find the average win-loss record of a player over a period of 4 years. His win-loss record looks like: 
 19/23, 13/16, 21/24, 19/22
 
 which means in the first year he won 19 of his 23 matches, in the second year he won 13 matches and lost 3, in the third year he played 24 times and won 21 times, and so on.  
 I want to find his consistency and hence I am looking for his average winning rate over the 4 years.   
 I thought it was quite straightforward but quite surprisingly it occurred to me that I can go about it in two ways when I found some discrepancies in the way I calculated it: 
 
 Add up all the wins during the 4 year stint and divide by the number of total matches played during that time.   
 So my player's consistency is measured like 
 (19 + 13 + 21 + 19) / (23 + 16 + 24 + 22) 
 
 which is  84.7% 
 Finding the average of win percentage of the 4 samples. 
 So my player's consistency is measured like 
 (19/23 + 13/16 + 21/24 + 19/22) / 4
 
 which is  84.43% 
 
 Well at first being so naive  I thought either way I should get the exact same result , but no! I then thought there must be some rounding issues in the second case which is why I get a different but close number. I tried to form a theoretical basis like shown below. 
 
 Let's say a player won ""a"" matches out of ""b"" matches played in first year, and in second year he won ""c"" matches out of ""d"" matches played. His consistency can be measured by the above two models like: 
 
 (a + c) / (b + d)
 
 or 
 (a/b + c/d) / 2    =>    (ad + bc) / 2bd
 
 
 Clearly the two aren't the same. So my questions are: 
 a. What is the practical difference between the two ways to calculate consistency? I'm not asking for a strict mathematical definitions, but trying to know in what real world scenarios the two different approaches make sense? The nature of my question is similar to this  question . I want to know how to calculate a player's consistency over a period of time and which model fits where. 
 b. Are there any technical terms in math world to denote the two ways of assessing average?

I'm also given this $hint$: For $1\leq i \le6$ let $E_i$ be the event that the outcome $i$ does not occur during the first $n$ tosses of the die. First calculate $P(X>n)$ by writing the event $X>n$ in terms of $E_1, E_2,...E_6$. 
 I know that $P(X>n)=1-P(X<n)$ and from $P(X<n)$ we can find the probability mass function. But I dont know how to find $P(X<n)$. 
 I looked and the answer is $$(\frac56)^{n-1}-5(\frac46)^{n-1}+10(\frac36)^{n-1}-10(\frac26)^{n-1}+5(\frac16)^{n-1}\quad for \quad n\ge6$$ I tried to derive how this was found but I found the alternating signs to be tricky and I'm also confused with why the coefficients are what they are.

 A coin has a probability of getting tails of  $\theta$  unknown. We would like to do the following hypothesis test over the value of  $\theta$ :
 $$\begin{cases}H_0 : \theta=0.5 \\ H_1 : \theta > 0.5 \end{cases}$$ 
Suppose we flipped the coin 5 times and got 4 tails. Calculate the p-value. 
 
 Let  $X$  be a random variable such that it takes  $1$  if we got tails, and  $0$  if heads (a Bernoulli distribution with unknown parameter  $\theta$ ) and  $X_1, \dots, X_5 $  a simple random sample of  $X$ . 
 Then the p-value is going to be  $P_{H_0}(T\geq t)$  (assuming  $H_0$  is true), with  $T=\overline{X}_n$  and  $t=\frac{4}{5}=0.8$ . 
 So,  $P_{H_0}(T\geq t)=P_{H_0}(\overline{X}_n\geq0.8)=1-P_{H_0}(\overline{X}_n <0.8)$ 
 By the central limit theorem,  $\overline{X}_n \sim N\left(0.5,\frac{(0.5)(1-0.5)}{5} \right)=N(0.5, 0.05)$  (approximately). 
 So,  $p-value=1-\phi \left(\frac{0.8-0.5}{0.22} \right)=0.0869$  which is incorrect. Where's my mistake?

How can I calculate this? 
 This question came up in some work that I'm doing and I'm getting confused about whether certain events are independent. 
 If we consider the simpler question about pairs of equal consecutive integers then we see  
 $$\begin{align}
& P(\mbox{at least one equal pair})\\
&=1-P(\mbox{no equal pairs})\\
&= 1-P(\mbox{each of the 23 possible pairs are not equal})\\
&=1-\left(1-\frac{1}{256}\right)^{23}
\end{align}$$ 
 where we have used the fact that two pairs being equal are independent (i.e. if we represent the first three numbers by $a,b$ and $c$ we see that whether $a\neq b$ is independent of whether $b\neq c$.)

"My major is mechanical engineering. Recently, I am working on some subject involving three-dimensional finite rotations. More specially, the necessary and sufficient conditions for an applied torque/moment be conservative in the finite rotation range. I have tried to read some math books, but I got more confused. The following is the description of the background. 
 In mechanics, an externally torque generally exhibits unusual property of configuration-dependent, which means the torque varies from its initial value $\mathbf M_0$ to its current value $\mathbf M$ when moving along a curve lying on SO(3) staring form the identity $\mathbf I$ to the current position $\mathbf R$. In other words, the current counterpart $\mathbf M$ can be viewed as a $\mathbf explicit function$ of the rotation $\mathbf R \in SO(3) $. 
 Let $\mathbf \delta \omega$ be the spatial spin (an element which belongs to the tangent space of SO(3) at the base point $\mathbf R$, i.e., $\mathbf \delta \omega \in T_{R}SO(3)$). Then the virtual work done by the torque over the spin is given by
$$\delta W = \mathbf M \cdot \delta \omega$$ 
 where $\delta W $ is a real number, and ""$\cdot$"" means dot product.
In mathematics, $\mathbf M$ is an element of cotangent space of SO(3) at the base point $\mathbf R$, i.e., $\mathbf M \in T^{*}_{R}SO(3)$.  
 On the other hand, if the rotation vector (axis-angle representation) $\mathbf \psi = \psi_{i} \mathbf e_{i}$ was used to parameterize the rotation manifold, $\mathbf R = exp(\hat \psi)$, then we can express the torque as $\mathbf M=\mathbf Q \mathbf M_0$ explicitly, where $\mathbf Q=\mathbf Q(\psi)$ is the transformation matrix relating the initial and current values of the torque. 
 We also can represent the virtual rotation by $\mathbf \delta \psi$, the variation of rotation vector $\mathbf \psi$, $\mathbf \delta \psi \in T_{I}SO(3)$. The relation between $\mathbf \delta \omega$ and $\mathbf \delta \psi$ is given by $ \delta \omega = \mathbf L \delta \psi$, where $\mathbf L= \mathbf L(\psi)$ is the tangential operator, $\mathbf L:T_ISO(3)\to T_RSO(3)$. Thus, the virtual work can be rewritten as
$$ \mathbf \delta W = \mathbf L^T \mathbf M \cdot \delta \psi$$ 
 My questions are: 
 
 Which expression of the virtual work is a differental 1-form in SO(3) and why?  
 How to calculate the line integral of the virtual work over a curve lying on SO(3) in terms of a differential 1-form? 
 
 Thank you very much!  
 EDIT 1: In the above description, the spin $\mathbf \delta \omega$ is not a differential, since there does not exist a variable from which the spin can be derived. It comes from the variation of the orthogonality condition of rotation matrix, $\mathbf \delta(\mathbf R \mathbf R^T=\mathbf I)=0$,  $\mathbf \delta \mathbf R=\widehat (\delta\omega) \mathbf R$. 
 However, the variation $\mathbf \delta \psi$ of rotation vector is a differential.

"Question: Let $V \subset M(n,n,\mathbb{R})$ be the set of all symmetric, real $(n \times n)$ matrices, that is $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ for all $i,j$. Show that $V$ is a subspace of $M(n,n,\mathbb{R})$ and calculate dim$(V)$. 
 My attempt so far:
First part: To show that $V$ is a subspace I need to show:
 (a) $ 0 \in V$ and 
 (b) $\forall A,B \in V:
  (i) A + B \in V
  (ii) \lambda A \in V$ 
 For (a) I would say: Let $a_{ij} \in 0$(this should represent a zero matrix, is that how to write it?)  
 $a_{ij} = 0 = a_{ji} \Rightarrow 0 \in V$ 
 For (b) I am actually confused since I would first think: both a $(2 \times 2)$ matrix and a $(3 \times 3)$ matrix belong to $V$ but addition of matrices of different size is undefined $\Rightarrow$ $V$ is not closed under addition $\Rightarrow$ $V$ is not a subspace of $M(n,n,\mathbb{R})$... what am I missing here? (To start I don't really understand the notation $M(n,n,\mathbb{R})$... what exactly does the $\mathbb{R}$ represent there?). 
 Disregarding my confusion I would still try to show (b), but my mathematical notation is still lacking competence... Is the following somewhat clear? Would anyone ever use ""$\in$"" to denote ""is an element of matrix""? 
 (i)Let $a_{ij},a_{ji} \in A$ and $b_{ij}, b_{ji} \in B$. Let $A,B \in V$ 
 $\Rightarrow a_{ij} = a_{ji}, b_{ij} = b_{ji}$ 
 $A + B = C \Rightarrow c_{ij} = (a_{ij}+b_{ij}) = (a_{ji} + b_{ij}) = (a_{ij} + b_{ji}) = c_{ji} = (a_{ji} + b_{ji})$ 
 $\Rightarrow C \in V$ 
 (ii) Let $A\in V, \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $a_{ij},a_{ji} \in A$. 
 $\Rightarrow a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ 
 $\lambda \cdot A = A'$ with $\lambda a_{ij} = \lambda a_{ji} \Rightarrow A' \in V$ 
 Second part: I feel that I understand the answer... For an $(n \times n)$ matrix, the diagonal length $ = n$ and these are the elements which have no counterpart and are not critical to the symmetry. When these elements are subtracted from the total$(n^{2})$, half of the remainder can be independently selected and the other half will follow as a result. Therefore I think it makes sense to write that dim$(V) = n + \frac{n^{2}-n}{2}$.  
 Is this correct? If so, given the context of the exercise, how could I make my answer more acceptable?

 I know that we have to find a projection and use that to find the orthogonal line from b to the line determined by c. However, I have no idea how to find the line determined by the point c and the direction of the vector v.  
 If the line determined by the vector v, and the new line through c, have the same direction, then they are parallel. However, I'm not sure how to calculate what this line actually is.  
 EDIT: Here's an example:  
 b = point (1, 2, 2, 4)
v = vector (1, 7, 7, 1)
c = point (4, 1, 2, 2)
 
 I'm confident that I can work this out on my own, once I can figure out how to determine the line through c with direction given by the vector v.

"I've seen on a lot of websites that your probability of death ""doubles"" every 8 years. 
 However, the way they calculate the probability of death seems to lead to counterintuitive conclusions. e.g on  http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2014/01/08/260463710/am-i-going-to-die-this-year-a-mathematical-puzzle  they calculate probability of death like this: 
 At 25 years old, your probability is 1 in 3000
At 33: 1 in 1500
+8 : 1 in 750 
 Presumably, the progression goes: 1 in 3000, then 1500, then 750, then 375, then 187.5, then 93.2, then 46.875, then 23.4375, then 11.71875, then ~5.86, then ~2.9, then ~1.5, then ~0.7. 
 But 1 in 0.7 = 1.36533... = over 136%

"I'm trying to derive formula for dependents events. 
 Let say we have a box with 5 balls: 2 whites and 3 red. Calculate the probability of: 
 
 get white first, then red 
 OR get red first, then white  
 
 As I understand, we should use formula P(A + B), where: 
 
 event A: get white ball 
 event B: get red ball 
 event (B|A): get red ball if white already taken 
 event (A|B): get white ball if red already taken 
 
 So, following events can happen:  
 $${\above 0pt A * (B|A)}$$
$${\above 0pt B * (A|B)}$$
$${{\above 0pt A \space * }{ \above 1pt {(B|A)}}}$$
$${{\above 0pt B \space * }{ \above 1pt {(A|B)}}}$$ 
 Therefore: 
 $${P(A + B) =  P(A) * P(B|A) + P(B) * P(A|B) + P(A) * (1 - P(B|A)) + P(B) * (1 - P(A|B))}$$
$${ = 2 * P(A) * P(B|A) + P(A) - P(A) * P(B|A) + P(B) - P(B) * P(A|B)}$$
$${ = 2 * P(A) * P(B|A) + P(A) - 2 * P(A) * P(B|A) + P(B)}$$
$${ = P(A) + P(B)}$$

"So, I've explored this a little, but it is still confusing. When you calculate the inverse of a function, f, that is one-to-one, the points switch: a point (2,8) on f would be (8,2) on the inverse. So, one would assume that the derivatives of the functions would also constitute the reversal of points. However, that is not the case. For example, you have: 
 $f (x) = 5x^2 \phantom{=}\text{ for  $x\geq0$}$ 
 $f '(x) = 10x$ 
 and  
 $(f^{-1}) (x) = \sqrt{\frac{x}{5}}$ 
 Here is my question: Why is finding the inverse of the derivative of $f$, $f '(x)$, and taking its inverse not the real derivative of the inverse? I would think $(f^{-1}) '(x) = \frac{x}{10}$, but that is not the case. The real inverse would be taking the derivative of $(f^{-1}) (x)$ and finding $(f^{-1}) '(x) = (\frac{1}{10\sqrt{x/5}})$. In my mind, both of these seem like they could be the derivatives of the inverse, yet only the latter is true. Why is this?  
 Also, maybe I missed out in class, but is there some sort of quick relationship between (besides the formula) $f '(x)$ and $(f^{-1}) '(x)$ similar to how points switch between $f (x)$ and $(f^{-1}) (x)$. 
 Thanks.

 This is one of the exercises in Do Carmo's book ""Differential forms and applications"". 
 I assume that by $f(x_1,\cdots, x_n) = (y_1,\cdots,y_n)$, he means that $y_i=f_i(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$.

"Let $X$ be an abelian variety. As abelian varieties are projective then $X$ contains lots and lots of subvarieties. Why can't one of them be a projective space? 
 If $X$ is defined over the complex numbers, then there is a relatively painless way to see this (modulo lots of painful differential geometry, depending on your tastes). Indeed, if $Z$ is a (say smooth) subvariety of any space $X$, then we have an exact sequence 
 $$
0 \longrightarrow T_Z \longrightarrow T_X \longrightarrow N_{Z/X} \longrightarrow 0.$$ 
 We can put a metric $\omega$ on $X$. By restriction, this gives a metric on $Z$. One can now calculate that the curvature of the metric on $Z$ is no more than that of the metric $\omega$ on $X$. 
 A torus admits flat metrics, that is Kähler metrics of zero curvature. If a torus could admit a projective space $\mathbb P^k$, we would then get a Kähler metric of non-positive curvature on $\mathbb P^k$. This cannot happen, for example, because then its Ricci curvature would be negative, in contradiction to the Ricci form representing the positive anticanonical bundle of $\mathbb P^k$. 
 Question:  Is there an algebraic way of seeing this? 
 I'm interested because I absolutely don't know. I have little intuition for algebraic methods and would like to try to change that, a simple example like this might be a good place to start.

"I'm trying to work through how to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 
 I start with  
 $$Ax=\lambda x$$ 
 Where $A$ is a $p \times p$ matrix, $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue and $x$ is the eigenvector. 
 This is the same as: 
 $$Ax=I\lambda x$$ 
 $$Ax-I\lambda x=0$$ 
 $$(A-I\lambda) x=0$$ 
 We define the matrix $A$ as a $2 \times 2$ matrix: 
 $\begin{bmatrix}4 & -2\\-3 & 6\end{bmatrix}$ 
 Thus this -$I\lambda$ equals 
 $\begin{bmatrix}4-\lambda & -2\\-3 & 6-\lambda\end{bmatrix}$ 
 $$Det(A-I\lambda)=(4-\lambda(6-\lambda)-(-3)*-2)$$ 
 $$Det(A-I\lambda)=24-10\lambda +\lambda^2 -6$$
$$Det(A-I\lambda)=18 - 10\lambda + \lambda^2 $$ 
 Then, out of the blue my textbook claims that 
 $$0=30 - 10\lambda + \lambda^2 $$

"1) A and B are playing a game where they each write their name on a card. A goes
first and chooses one of the two cards with equal probability. If A chooses her own card
then she wins. If she chooses B’s card, then it is B’s turn to play. He chooses one of the
two cards randomly with equal probability, and he wins if gets his own card. Otherwise, the
turn passes back to A and she tries again. This pattern continues until one or the other
has won. Calculate the probability that A will win this game. (it is not 1/2.) 
 
 I'm assuming the way to do this is geometric distribution, but I'm still a but confused on this. I was trying to use sigma notation to denote how to calculate it, but I don't know how to go about this. I'm getting 1/2 which obviously isn't the answer.  
 
 2) C walks up and wants to join the game so she adds a card with her name into the pile.
Now, if A draws B’s card then he goes next and if she draws C’s card then C
goes next. At each turn, the person drawing a card will win if they draw their own card,
and otherwise the turn will pass to whoever is named on the card. Every card is drawn
independently with all three cards having equal probability. They continue to take turns
until somebody wins. Calculate the probability of A winning, the probability of B
winning, and the probability of C winning. 
 
 Also assuming this is the same approach as the last problem, but instead of using 1/2, we use 1/3.

"I have been in a deep confusion for about a month over the topic of limits! According to our book, the limit at $a$ is the value being approached by a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$. 
 I have a doubt that in real number line we can never ever reach the closest value to $a$ because always a more closer value will exist. 
 Now when talking about our methods for calculating limit, what method comes in our mind when we have to calculate where the value approaches? Let's say we have to find what value $f(x)$ approaches when $x$ moves from $[0,a)$. 
 So we calculate the value of $f(x)$ at $x=0$, say $4$, and then at $x\to a$.  
 But the problem is that we don't know the value $x\to a$, so we say the value is $a-h$ where $h\to 0$ and calculate the value of $f(a-h)$, say $5-h$. 
 Now here is where my doubt starts! In the final step we put the value of $h=0$ say in that it is an infinitesimal quantity. 
 My doubt is that $h$ was tending to $0$ means that it was never equal to zero  maybe it is infinitesimally small, not a stationary value, not an imaginable value, but we know for sure that it is not  equal to $0$. Maybe it is the point closest to zero, but it is not equal to zero and when we use the result $5-h=5$ we are actually making an error which is tending to zero. Maybe the error is very small, but still, there is some error in that we cannot calculate it but we can see that there is this infinitesimal error present. 
 That means we don't get the exact limiting value or last value of $f(x)$. 
 $x$ belongs to $[0,a)$ but a value approximate to infinitesimal? Isn't it right! We get an approximated value?

"In my course we defined the pullback  $f^{*}\omega$  of a differential  $k$ -Form  $\omega: V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \to \bigwedge^k\left(\mathbb{R}^n\right)$  via a differentiable map  $f: U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m \to V$  as 
 $$
(f^{*}\omega)(x)[v_1, ..., v_k] := \omega(f(x))[f'(x)v_1, ..., f'(x)v_k].
$$ 
 However, I have some trouble understanding this definition. In particular I don't quite understand what  exactly  is meant by the terms  $f'(x)v_i$ . I suppose these vectors are supposed to be the new inputs for the resulting  $k$ -Form over  $U$ . Let me showcase my confusion with the help of an example. Let  $\omega = xdx + ydy + zdz$  and  $f:[0,2\pi]\to\mathbb{R}^3$  is the curve  $f(t) = (e^{t\sin{t}},t^2 - 2\pi t, \cos{\frac{t}{2}})$ .
Then we have  $f'(t) = ((\sin{t} + t\cos{t})e^{t\sin{t}}, 2t - 2\pi, -\frac{1}{2}\sin{\frac{t}{2}})$  and the above definition should reduce to: 
 $$
(f^{*}\omega)(t)[v] = \omega(f(t))[f'(x)v]
$$ 
where  $v = (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3$ . Going further:
 $$
(f^{*}\omega)(t)[v] = \left(e^{t\sin{t}}dx + (t^2 - 2\pi t)dy + \cos{\frac{t}{2}}dz\right)[f'(x)v].
$$ 
Now, to me the only sensible way to calculate  $f'(t)v$  is calculating the dot product  $\langle f'(t), v\rangle$ , since both  $f'(t)$  and  $v$  are vectors of  $\mathbb{R}^3$  and don't really know of another way to multiply two of those (i think the cross product is out of question here). However, the dot product yields only a scalar, but the  $1$ -Form is waiting for another 3-vector. So this can't be right. What is the correct way to calculate this pullback?

 What I have been able to determine is, from the eccentricity, since e < 1, then the conic is actually an ellipse, right? My next step is to calculate a, b, c, from the eccentricity. Since it's given that $e=\frac{2}{3}$, and $e=\frac{c}{a}$, it seems simple enough to say that $c=2$, $a=3$ and then determine $b$ from Pitagoras' theorem. But I am unsure, as $c=4$, $a=6$ would also give the same eccentricity value. How would be the way to continue?  
 Also, given that the directrix is $x=6$, and the focus given is to the left side of the directrix, I'd guess that the focus I was given is the right focus on an horizontal ellipse. Since the eccentricity is the distance between centre and foci, I'd say that the centre is located at $(0-\frac{2}{3}, 3)$ and the other focus is at $(0-\frac{2}{3}-\frac{2}{3}, 3)$. But I'm not entirely sure I'm allowed to do that, is this the correct approach?

 Is there a purely theoretic proof that works with no calculation at all, or is there a calculational argument that would be practical prior to  $1950$ ? 
 Edit : Let me phrase the question a little differently, as a spur to your mathematical imagination. I go back in time to  $1847$  and have lunch with Carl Friedrich Gauss.  We are chatting about the developments in  $20$ th and  $21$ st-century mathematics, and because I am a horrible person, I mention that  $(\pi^\pi)^{\pi^\pi}$  has been proven to be an integer. Gauss is incredulous, but I insist. After I leave, can Gauss convince himself that I am nothing but a troll? 
 Edit : After I looked back at  McBride's original question , I saw to my dismay that he had not asked about  $x= (\pi^\pi)^{\pi^\pi}$ , but  $$y=\pi^{\left(\pi^{\pi^\pi}\right)}$$  which is a rather different animal. The value of  $x$  has  $57$  decimal digits; the value of  $y$  has  $10^{57}$   digits .  So Alexander Walker's impressive display of direct numerical calculation will avail nothing for deciding that  $y$  is not an integer, neither in  $1873$  nor in  $2013,$  and perhaps not in  $2153$  either. (""We should attempt to destroy the aliens."") More powerful theoretical methods will be required.  I am posting an additional bounty to see if anyone can suggest anything of that sort; it need not be theory that was available in the  $19$ th century.

"This is a slight variant on a normal probability of getting k successes in n draws type question that I can't seem to find guidance for.  
 Suppose we have a standard 52-card deck and we want to calculate the probability of drawing k number of Hearts in x amount of rounds. Each round, we draw 5 cards at a time, and keep the successes (in this case any Heart), putting the non-successes back in and shuffling the deck before drawing another 5. How do we calculate say, the probability of drawing 3 Hearts in 5 rounds of this? 
 I know to use a hypergeometric distribution for thinking about drawing without replacement regardless of success, but I was wondering if there's a distribution (and corresponding pmf for calculating probabilities) for this type of case. I can answer this kind of question fine with simulation, but I'm very curious to know how to approach this mathematically. I can somewhat envision a tree with ""compounding"" hypergeometric distributions, but I'm having trouble generalizing/formalizing it.

"There are two tennis players playing against each other. Denote the players player1 and player2. The probability of player1 to win a single match is  $\mathbb{P} = \dfrac{2}{3}$ , independently of the results of the previous matches. The two play until one of them wins 3 matches. What is the probability that player1 wins the game? 
 
So I started by Defining a random variable  $X_{i}$  that indicates whether player1 win or lose in the i'ts match. Meaning,  $X_{i} = 1$  if player1 wins ths i'th match, and  $X_{i} = 0$  otherwise. Let's denote by  $A_{n}$  the event in which after  $n$  matches player1 wins, and later we will take  $n \rightarrow \infty$ . 
Now we can notice that for every  $1 \leq i \leq n$  it holds that  $X_{i} \sim Ber \left( \dfrac{2}{3} \right)$ , and so  $Y = \sum ^{n}_{i=1}X_{i} \sim Bin \left( n, \dfrac{2}{3} \right)$ , and that's because all the  $X_{i}$ 's are independent on each other. 
Now we want to calculate the event  $\mathbb{P} \left( A_{n} \right) = \mathbb{P} \left( Y=3 \right) = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}^{3}\cdot \left( \dfrac{1}{3}\right) ^{n-3}$  and after simplifying it we get  $\mathbb{P} \left( A_{n} \right) =\mathbb{P} \left( Y=3 \right) = \dfrac{4 \cdot n \cdot \left( n-1 \right) \cdot \left( n-2 \right)}{3^{n+1}}$ , So  $\lim _{n\rightarrow \infty } \mathbb{P} \left( A_{n}\right) = 0$ . 
So the probability is  $0$  ? It doesn't make any sense for me.

"I'm the author of application for android called  Calculator++ 
One of the users submitted a bug in the integration of trigonometric functions. And I'm absolutely disagree with him. 
 In my app I use approach to calculate trigonometric functions differently in different modes (I mean DEG/RAD modes), e.g.:  
 
 in rad mode you can type $\sin(\pi/ 3)$ and get result $0.866$ 
 in deg mode you type $\sin(60°) (≡ sin(60))$ and get the same result 
 
 So, strictly speaking in different modes I've got different sin functions - in deg it is a function of degree argument and in rad mode - function of radian argument. 
 Calculator++ allows to get the integral of sin function and in both modes: $\int\sin(x)dx = - \cos(x)$ 
 And here is the misunderstanding: user says that correct integration formula is: 
 
 RAD: $\int\sin(x)dx = - \cos(x)$ 
 DEG: $\int\sin(x)dx = - \pi / 180 \times \cos(x)$ (user assumes that variable modification is needed for correct integration) 
 
 I want to ask who is correct in this argument - me or user?

"I'm building a calculator for International Bank Account Numbers (IBAN) but I'm having trouble calculating the modulus for a big number. That is to say, my results are not the same as that of the examples I have.  
 To calculate the IBAN checksum I have to follow these steps (taken from  WikiPedia ): 
 
 Replace the two check digits by 00 (e.g., GB00 for the UK). 
 Move the four initial characters to the end of the string. 
 Replace the letters in the string with digits, expanding the string as necessary, such that A or a=10, B or b=11 and Z or z=35. Each alphabetic character is therefore replaced by 2 digits. 
 Convert the string to an integer (i.e., ignore leading zeroes). 
 Calculate Mod-97 of the new number. 
 Subtract the remainder from 98 and, if necessary, pad with a leading 0 to make a two digit number. 
 
 For example NL20INGB0001234567 
 
 NL00INGB0001234567 
 INGB0001234567NL00 
 182316110001234567232100 
 182316110001234567232100 
 182316110001234567232100 % 97 = 67 
 98 - 67 = 31 
 
 Since 31 does not equal 20 I conclude that something went wrong. According to an example 182316110001234567232100 % 97 should yield 78 but I don't see how.

\dfrac{1}{2} & x=1 \\
x-1 & 1 < x<2 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$ 
 The book I am reading doesn't have much (any!) information on two-point mixed distributions and I want to make sure that I understand how this PDF was derived from the CDF. My understanding so far is that firstly, we need to figure out from the CDF that  $X$  follows a mixed distribution. Note that  $F(1) = 1/2 \ne 0$ , which indicates that there is a jump in the CDF of  $X$  at  $x=1$ . Since  $X$  is continuous from  $1<x<2$ ,  $X$  must follow a two-point mixed distribution. Now, the magnitude of the jump in the graph is  $\frac{1}{2}-0 = \frac{1}{2}$  which gives  $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}$  if  $x=1$ . The rest of the pdf can be obtained using routine computations. Finally, we need to compute the probabilistic ""weights"" to get to the CDF. Clearly, the ""weight"" for the discrete part is  $\frac{1}{2}$ , so the ""weight"" for the continuous part must be  $1-\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$ , and we have 
 $$E[X] = \int_1^2 (x-1) \cdot x dx + \text{Weight for the discrete part} \cdot 1 = \int_1^2 x(x-1) dx + P[X=1] \cdot 1$$ 
 $$= \int_1^2 x(x-1) dx + \frac{1}{2}$$ 
 which gives the correct answer. However, I am more interested in learning whether my process for obtaining the answer (which was based mostly on deduction and intuition) is correct. Can someone please critique my post? Thanks!

 OK 
 Now, I understand that an integral is basically the opposite of a derivative. I also understand that it finds the area under the graph of a function. 
 Based on what I understood, while integrating you take a very small change in the variable  $x$  (or maybe  $\mathrm{d}x$ ) such that the change in  $f\left(x\right)$  is constant and therefore calculate the area of the rectangle and add the areas... 
 However, my question here is how does the integration tool include all the areas
bound under its limit, it makes less sense to me.
For example:
 $$\int_2^4 x\,\mathrm{d}x$$ 
 Solving the integral: 
 You get
 $$\frac{x^2}{2}$$ 
with limits  $4$  and  $2$ .
So, now you substitute the limits and subtract them .....
but this is what feels weird, it looks like I'm only subtracting the area at  $4$  and  $2$ ,
How does this tool work 
 (Any response would be helpful)
EDIT:
(i want to make my question a bit more clear) 
 [My question is basically, how does integration include all the areas between the interval, i have seen a couple of proofs on the fundamental theorem of calculus
however, that just seemed to explain why we subtract while integrating (to remove the constant term (i think).The problem i guess i am facing is that there is no hint of a summation of areas happening,and this is exactly what my question is -how do we know the areas are included??]

 My attempt: 
 We have for  $|x|\leq1$   $$\tanh^{-1}(x)=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$$

 \begin{align*}

 \begin{align*}
J_1&=\displaystyle\int_0^{\sqrt{2}-1}\frac{\log(1+x)}{x}\mathrm{d}x\\
&=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}\displaystyle\int_0^{\sqrt{2}-1}x^n\mathrm{d}x\\

 Cashews cost 4.75 per pound and hazelnuts cost 4.50 per pound. What is
  larger, the number of pounds of cashews in a mixture of cashews and
  hazelnuts that costs $5.50 per pound, or 1.25? Alternatively, are they
  equal, or is it impossible to calculate? 
 
 My answer:
I believe that 1.25 is larger. I conclude this because even if a 1.25lb mix were entirely composed of cashews, it would be more costly than $5.50/lb. Therefore, the mixture must have fewer than 1.25lbs of cashews, and 1.25 is greater. 
 The supposed answer:
""There is no way to calculate the number of pounds of either nut in the mixture. We can calculate the ratio of the number of pounds of cashews to the number of pounds of hazelnuts required of the mixture to cost $5.50 per pound, but without knowing how many total pounds the mixture is, we cannot calculate the number of pounds of either component.""

 How many subsets of set  $\{1,2,\ldots,10\}$  contain at least one odd integer?      
 
 My Working: 
What I can think of is subtracting the no. of subsets that don't contain a single odd number from the total number of subsets as if we calculate it for single cases (like  $1$  odd integer,  $2$  odd integers,  $\ldots$ ) it would be pretty long.     
 As there needs to be no odd integer, the maximum number of elements in the set is  $5$  (only  $5$  even integers are there in the superset).    
 Case 1:   $0$  elements:  $1$  set 
 Case 2:   $1$  element:  $5$  sets ( $1$  even integer in each set) 
 Case 3:   $2$  elements:  $(5)(5)$  sets ( $1$  element odd and  $1$  even)  $+\binom{5}{2}$   sets (both elements even) 
which gives  $35$  sets

 The accompanying solution says that it's because the uptown train always arrives one minute after the downtown train, which in turn arrives nine minutes after the uptown train, in this time span. So there's a nine-to-one chance that Marvin will get on the downtown train and not the uptown one.

       I have been given the sum of orders placed per instrument(security or company) for about 25000+ instruments. So my dataset looks something like this: 
 [Instrument] [Order count]   [Average Order Size(AOS)]  [Orders above 10*AOS]

   AAA            20                 10000.0                 ?
   BBB            5000               24334.5                 ?
   ...................
 
 I know the average order size placed for an instrument as shown above. I want to calculate an estimate for the number of orders placed which had a order size above  10*[average order size]  per instrument. I don't have an idea about the distribution. Assuming it's a normal distribution, I don't have an idea about the standard deviation. Is there any way to get a practical answer (I don't care if it is a value in a range.) for my problem? I hope this question is relevant here. Thanks.

"I'm trying to calculate the circumference of a circle given say three reference points from a 2d coordinates that would form an arc. 
 The problem is the reference points may be slightly inaccurate so i'm using three to hopefully get an exact arc. 
 Once I have my 3 reference points how can I calculate the circumference? 
 I'm attaching an image so you may better understand what I'm trying to do.

 [edit]
Also, the reason I'm doing it this way is that the image is a scan and top or side of the circle may be chopped off so getting the diameter may not always be possible and the size
of the circle differs from time to time.

"Suppose we would like to find a formula for some interesting real-valued function on the positive integers  $f(n):\mathbb{Z}^+\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ , and we have the inductive equation 
 $$\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}^+,\quad f(n+1)=f(n)+p(n)$$ 
 for some polynomial  $p(x):\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ . It should be intuitively obvious that  $f(n)$  is also a polynomial, or at least that there exists a polynomial which is equal to  $f(n)$  on the positive integers. Let  $q(x):\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$  be such a polynomial: 
 $$ \forall n\in\mathbb{Z}^+,\quad f(n)=q(n) $$ 
 Furthermore, the degree of  $q(x)$  is one more than the degree of  $p(x)$ : 
 $$ \deg q(x) = \deg p(x) + 1$$ 
 This allows the use of polynomial interpolation with the first  $d+1$  points of  $f(n)$  to calculate the coefficients of  $q(x)$ , and thus find a formula for  $f(n)$ . I would like a proof for the existence of the polynomial  $q(x)$ . 
 
 Proposition: If  $f(n):\mathbb{Z}^+\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$  is a function such that there exists a polynomial  $p(x):\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$  of degree  $d$  such that
   $$\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}^+,\quad f(n+1)=f(n)+p(n)$$ 
  then there exists a polynomial  $q(x):\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$  of degree  $d+1$  such that  $f(n)=q(n)$  for all  $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ . 
 
 For example, let  $f(n):\mathbb{Z}^+\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$  be the sum-of-squares function defined
 $$f(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2$$ 
 For all positive integers  $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ , the function  $f(n)$  satisfies the equation 
 $$f(n+1)=f(n)+(n+1)^2$$ 
 Let  $p(x)$  be the polynomial of degree  $2$  defined  $p(x)=(x+1)^2$  for all  $x\in\mathbb{R}$ . From the proposition, there exists a polynomial  $q(x)$  of degree  $3$  such that  $f(n)=q(n)$  for all  $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ . Thus, we can use polynomial interpolation with the points  $f(1)=1$ ,  $f(2)=5$ ,  $f(3)=14$ , and  $f(4)=30$  to calculate the coefficients of  $q(x)$ . This yields:
 $$q(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x$$ 
For  $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ , this matches the standard formula:  $$f(n)=\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$ 
 This is a simple example, but this technique has helped me obtain formulas for complex recurrences simply by knowing what degree it will have.

 The rule I have to adhere is, that the biggest item can't be bigger than 40% and the others not more than 30% of the whole. Amounts cannot be increased, only decreased. So I get this:

 This reducing the amounts also reduced the sum, which is want I want, but  $40.00  is obviously more than 40% of  $90.00 . So I must do it again: 
 A: min( $40.00, $ 90.00 * 0.4) =  $36.00 (43.3% of $ 83)
B: min( $30.00, $ 90.00 * 0.3) =  $27.00 (32.5% of $ 83)

                               $83.00
 
 But again, the A now represents about 43% of the total, and B 32%, higher than the limits I want to adhere. 
 For these small numbers, it takes 20 rounds to come to this result, which is final thanks to the fact that I can't have parts of cents and I always round down:

The assumptions that one makes is just that log is the natural logarithm,  $x\epsilon\mathcal{R}$  and generally maybe some assumptions that a first year calculus course would assume. Nothing too complicated. 
 The question is the following: How do you somewhat rigorously attack this thing? 
 My thoughts: 
 If you see this as a whole is an undefined quantity of the type:  $0 \cdot \infty$ . 
 If you see it as parts you have a number  $0$  and a limit that diverges. Since the limit does not exist (of course we implicitly assume that  $\lim_{x\to0^{+}}$ ) we could not use the multiplication rule. 
 Hypothetically if we could use the multiplication rule we run into problems of what function's limit should we represent  $0$  with.  $x$ ?  $x^2$ ?  $x^{1/10}$ ?

 the Start Direction in rad (direction) 
 the Radius of the Arc (radius) 
 the Length of the Arc (length)

In a first step, I am calculating the Centre Point (x_c, y_c) of the Arc Segment, which already works correctly. 
 I now need to calculate the Mid and End Point of the Arc Segment. At the moment I am using the following to do so ('dist' is the distance along the segment, and therefore 0.5 for the midpoint and 1 for the endpoint): 
 if arc is clockwise: angle = dist * length / radius
if arc is counter-clockwise: angle = - dist * length / radius

x = x_c + radius * cos(direction + angle) (I)
y = y_c - radius * sin(direction + angle) (II)

just by first taking nth derivative and then integrating n times. From what I've learnt, in the region of convergence of this power series (which is obviously  $(-\infty, \infty)$ ), the following equation holds:
 $$
\int\cdots\int\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!}(dx)^n=\int\cdots\int\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!}(dx)^n=\int\cdots\int\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{n}}{n!}(dx)^n

that is, you can change the order of taking derivative and summing, and  $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{n}}{n!}$  is just  $e^x$ , so integrate it n times should also be  $e^x$ . So the sum function (the way I see it) is just  $e^x$ .

 where  $\textbf{A}$  is a square matrix containing the coefficients of the linear equations,  $\textbf{x}$  is a column vector of length  $n$  containing the unknown parameters that I want to calculate, and  $\textbf{b}$  is a known vector of length  $n$ . 
 Given no other constraints, the solution is to simply calculate  $\textbf{x}$  by inverting  $\textbf{A}$ . However, I have hard inequality constraints on  $\textbf{x}$  because of physical reasons of the data in question: 
 $$
0 \leq x_i \leq c_i \ \forall \ i=1,2,...n 
$$ 
 where  $x_i$  are the values in  $\textbf{x}$  and all  $c_i$  are known. 
 Now, these extra inequality constraints make the problem overdetermined. However, I have the choice to remove data (e.g., remove rows from  $\textbf{A}$ ) because I know a priori that some data are more reliable. Thus, I am hoping that I can make the unconstrained problem underdetermined, but  given the hard inequality constraints, make the constrained problem exactly determined  and calculate a single unique solution of  $\textbf{x}$ . 
 To summarize, my question is: how can I solve a determined system of linear equations subject to inequality constraints on the unknown parameters? 
 I looked into a few potential techniques like linear programming and bounded variable least squares. However, the goal of those methods is to maximize or minimize some objective function, whereas I want an exact solution to my equations. My gut feeling is that a solution should exist but I don't have the linear algebra background to find it, so I appreciate any help!

 When I do this, I calculate  $\frac{2,023,632}{133,784,560}$ , which equals about  $0.015$ , or  $1.5\%$ . However,  wikipedia  says I should be getting about 2.6%. Why is my answer so wrong?

"This question is a follow-on from  this question 
. 
 I am trying to determine the probability of each horse finishing 2nd and each horse finishing 3rd. I have developed code to calculate the probabilities by implementing the formulas provided in the above mentioned question. 
 Each horse is represented by a 'horseData' object containing variables such as the horse id (a unique number to identify the horse), the probability of winning (Pw), the probability of finishing 2nd (P2nd), the probability of finishing third (P3rd) among other variables. All of the HorseData objects are contained in a List called hdList. 
 The following code implements the formula:
$$
P(i,2)= \sum_{i \neq x} (P_x . \frac {P_i}{(1 - P_x)  })
$$ 
 // Calc 2nd place for each horse
for (HorseData hdi : hdList) {
    for (HorseData hdx : hdList) {
        if (hdi.id != hdx.id) {
            term = hdx.Pw * hdi.Pw / (1 - hdx.Pw);
            hd.addToP2nd(term);
        }
    }
}
 
 This calculates the probability of finishing 2nd for each horse. The sum of these probabilities adds to one. All good so far.  
 The following code implements the formula: 
 $$
P(i,3)= \sum_{i \neq x \neq y}( P_x . P_{y2nd} .\frac {P_i}{(1 - P_x - P_{y2nd})  })
$$ 
 // Calc prob 3rd place for each horse
for (HorseData hdi : hdList) {
    for (HorseData hdx : hdList) {
        if (hdi.id != hdx.id) {
            for (HorseData hdy : hdList) {
                if ((hdx.id != hdy.id) & (hdi.id != hdy.id)) {
                    term = hdx.Pw * hdy.P2nd * hdi.Pw / (1 - hdx.Pw - hdy.P2nd);
                    hd.addToP3rd(term);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
 
 This calculates the probability of finishing 3rd for each horse. However the sum of these probabilities does not add to one. 
 For testing, I have a 5 horse race, with the Pw = 0.2 for all horses. 
 The code to calculate P2nd returns 0.2 for each horse, however the code to calculate P3rd returns 0.16 for each horse (whereas I think it should be 0.2). 
 Any assistance in reviewing the formulas and the code implementation would be appreciated.

"I have to calculate the divergence of an electric field and the charge in a cylindrical space ($r=3$, $z=3$).

"I want to find the curl of the vector $(\vec{u}\cdot\nabla)\vec{u}$ given that $\vec{\omega} = \nabla\times\vec{u}$ and $\nabla\cdot\vec{u}=\nabla\cdot\vec{\omega}=0$ however I'm not too sure how to go about this.  
 The curl of a dot product is undefined since the dot product is a scalar and a curl only acts on a vector so how would one take the curl here? 
 Edit: I have tried another method which leads to another question 
 Using the identity 
 $$\vec{u}\times(\nabla\times\vec{v})+\vec{v}\times(\nabla\times\vec{u}) = \nabla(\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}) - (\vec{u}\cdot\nabla)\vec{v} - (\vec{v}\cdot\nabla)\vec{u}$$ 
 with $\vec{v}=\vec{u}$. We find that 
 $$2\vec{u}\times(\nabla\times\vec{u}) = \nabla(\vec{u}\cdot\vec{u}) - 2(\vec{u}\cdot\nabla)\vec{u} \implies (\vec{u}\cdot\nabla)\vec{u}=\frac{1}{2}\nabla(\vec{u}\cdot\vec{u}) - \vec{u}\times(\nabla\times\vec{u})$$ 
 So taking the curl of this we find 
 $$\nabla\times\left[(\vec{u}\cdot\nabla)\vec{u}\right] = -\nabla\times\vec{u}\times(\nabla\times\vec{u})$$

"The title problem is just one specific example of a more generalized problem that I'm trying to solve. I'm trying to write an efficient algorithm for calculating the probability of at least k occurrences each of several dependent events occurring in a particular sample space. It is the presence of wildcards and multiple types of events here that is making the problem difficult for me. 
 I originally asked a simpler version of the problem here:  What is the probability of of drawing at least one king and one ace in a five card poker hand? 
 This led me to conclusion that  inclusion-exclusion  is the way to go here.  I think seeing the answer to the title problem (without any reductions) will help me design my algorithm for the general case.  This is what I have so far: 
 $D := $ the set of all 9-card hands
$$|D| = {\binom{52}{9}}.$$ 
 $Q := $ the set of all 9-card hands containing zero Queens:
$$|Q| = {\binom{4}{0}\binom{48}{9}}.$$ 
 $Q_a := $ the set of all 9-card hands containing at least one Queen:
$$|Q_a| = {|D|-|Q|}$$ 
 $K := $ the set of all 9-card hands containing zero or one King:
$$|K| = {\binom{4}{0}\binom{48}{9}+\binom{4}{1}\binom{48}{8}}$$ 
 $K_a := $ the set of all 9-card hands containing at least two Kings:
$$|K_a| = {|D|-|K|}$$ 
 $A := $ the set of all 9-card hands containing zero, one or two Aces:
$$|A| = {\binom{4}{0}\binom{48}{9}+\binom{4}{1}\binom{48}{8}+\binom{4}{2}\binom{48}{7}}$$ 
 $A_a := $ the set of all 9-card hands containing at least three Aces:
$$|A_a| = {|D|-|A|}$$ 
 $X := $ the set of all 9-card hands containing at least 1 Queen, 2 Kings and 3 Aces:
$$|X| = |D|-[|Q|+|K|+|A|-|Q\cap K|-|K\cap A|-|Q\cap A|+|Q\cap K\cap A|]$$ 
 And of course, the probability of drawing one such hand is just:
$$\frac{|X|}{|D|}$$ 
 Is that correct so far?  This is where I feel it's getting complicated.  How do you calculate for example $|K\cap A|$?  What does it mean to be a hand with ""(zero or one King) AND (zero, one or two Aces)""?  This smells like we would need to find all valid sets of $k$ Kings and $a$ Aces and add their cardinalities together. 
 $S(k,a) := $ the set of 9-card hands containing exactly $k$ Kings and $a$ Aces 
 $S(q,k,a) := $ the set of 9-card hands containing exactly $q$ Queens, $k$ Kings and $a$ Aces 
 First, are the following correct? 
 $$|S(k,a)| = \binom{4}{k}\binom{4}{a}\binom{44}{9-k-a}$$
$$|S(q,k,a)| = \binom{4}{q}\binom{4}{k}\binom{4}{a}\binom{40}{9-q-k-a}$$ 
 If so, are the following true? 
 $$|K\cap A| = \sum\limits_{a=0}^{2}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{1} |S(k,a)|$$
$$|Q\cap K\cap A| = \sum\limits_{a=0}^{2}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{1}\sum\limits_{q=0}^{0} |S(q,k,a)|$$

 Example: a 5 Sided polygon's interior angles will add up to 540 degrees.  ((5-2)*180=540) . 
 Given the following interior angles: 
 AB 140 degrees
BC 144 degrees
CD 78 degrees
DE 102 degrees
EA 76 degrees
 
 And knowing that Side A is 12 units long, can we determine the remaining side lengths? Or are more side lengths needed? 
 UPDATE: 
 Since you need three consecutive side lengths of a five sided figure, I'm adding three sides here so I can see an example of how the calculations are done for the remaining two sides: 
 Side A = 27 7/8""
Side B = 7""
Side c = 13 1/4""

 I would like to calculate 
  $$\lim\limits_{x\to a}\left(2-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)^{\tan\left( \dfrac{\pi x}{2a}\right)},\quad a \in\mathbb{R}^* \,\,\text{fixed} $$ 
 
 we've 
$$\left(2-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)^{\tan\left( \dfrac{\pi x}{2a}\right)}=e^{\tan\left( \dfrac{\pi x}{2a}\right)\ln\left(2-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)}.$$ 
 Note that: 
 $$\ln\left(2-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)\sim_{a}1-\dfrac{x}{2}.$$ 
 Now we have $\dfrac{\pi x}{2a}\underset{x\to a}{\longrightarrow} \dfrac{\pi}{2}$, i.e.$\dfrac{\pi x}{2a}-\dfrac{\pi}{2}  \underset{x\to a}{\longrightarrow} 0$ and $\tan h \sim_{0}h.$ 
 I'm stuck. 
 Update: here is another way : 
 \begin{aligned}
\left(2-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)^{\tan\left( \dfrac{\pi x}{2a}\right)}&=\exp\left[{\tan\left( \dfrac{\pi x}{2a}\right)\ln\left(2-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)}\right].\\
&=\exp\left[ \left(1-\dfrac{x}{a}\right)\tan\left(\dfrac{\pi x}{2a}-\dfrac{\pi}{2}+\dfrac{\pi}{2} \right).\dfrac{\ln\left(2-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)}{1-\dfrac{x}{a}}\right]\\
&=\exp\left[ -\dfrac{\left(1-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)}{\tan\left(\dfrac{\pi x}{2a}-\dfrac{\pi}{2} \right)}.\dfrac{\ln\left(2-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)}{\left(1-\dfrac{x}{a}\right)}\right]\\
&=\exp\left[ -\dfrac{\left(1-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)}{\tan\left(-\dfrac{\pi}{2}\left(1-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)\right)}.\dfrac{\ln\left(2-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)}{\left(1-\dfrac{x}{a}\right)}\right]\\
&=\exp\left[ \dfrac{2}{\pi} \dfrac{\dfrac{\pi}{2}\left(1-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)}{\tan\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\left(1-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)\right)}.\dfrac{\ln\left(2-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)}{\left(1-\dfrac{x}{a}\right)}\right]\\
\end{aligned} 
 Thus 
$$\lim\limits_{x\to a}\left(2-\dfrac{x}{a} \right)^{\tan\left(\dfrac{\pi x}{2a}\right)}  =e^{\dfrac{2}{\pi}} $$

 I've looked at Wikipedia, and I don't quite understand how at works. Example 1 on  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial#Example_1  seems to be the closest to what I'm trying to do, but I don't know how to get the basis polynomials, i.e. turning the middle section into the right section. I can probably get it to the interpolating section from there.

 I am implementing a local search algorithm and the values I am trying to correlate are the cost weightings of consecutive local optimum. I do not know how these are related but am trying to find out! That said .. I know the values will not have a zero mean. As the quality of the final solution I get is dependent on quickly evaluating lots of solutions on the way I need these stats to be generated efficiently.  
 Also it is worth mentioning that the frequency with which I need to read the correlation is less than the frequency with which new data points arrive, so if there is an efficiency to be gained in leaving parts of the calculation to when I really need to know the value then this is relevant. 
 I am separately calculating the Standard Deviation of the values at run time so can use this to convert from covariance to correlation.

 Its statement looks like this : 
 
 A recent lab accident resulted in the creation of an extremely dangerous virus that replicates so rapidly it's hard to predict exactly how many cells it will contain after a given period of time. However, a lab technician made the following observations about its growth per millisecond: 
 $\bullet$  The probability of the number of virus cells growing by a factor of  $a$  is  $0.5$ 
 $\bullet$  The probability of the number of virus cells growing by a factor of  $b$  is  $0.5$ 
 Given a, b, and knowing that initially there is only a single cell of virus, calculate the expected number of virus cells after  $t$  milliseconds. As this number can be very large, print your answer modulo  $(10^9 + 7)$  . 
 
 As I have no prior training in probability or combinatorics, this problem doesn't make much sense to me .

 p1()  is given from the relation:  
 p1(i)=(log(E(N(i-1))/E(N(i)))/(log((1./N(i-1))/(1./N(i))))); 
 p1_max()  is the maximum  p1()  for a specific  rho .  
 p_max  is the maximum values of all  p1_max() . We get this values for  rho=0.000000 
 But this cannot be trues, because that would mean that backward Euler method has the maximum order.

 I did the following job: in order to find a proper  $N\in\mathbb{N}_+$  for a fixed  $\epsilon>0$ , calculate (supposing  $m>n$ )
 \begin{align*}
|x_m-x_n|={}&\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n+2}}+\ldots+\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}-2\sqrt{m}+2\sqrt{n}\right|\\
\leq{}&\left|\frac{m-n}{\sqrt{n}}-2\frac{m-n}{\sqrt{m}+\sqrt{n}}\right|,
\end{align*} 
and I got stuck… I can’t let  $m$  disappear and think only about  $n$ , which means I’m not able to find the  $N$  as required.. Did I go too far on zooming the inequality? 
 ——— 
 So I followed the hint by @Gribouillis and get:
 \begin{align*}
x_n-x_{n+1}={}&-2\sqrt{n}+2\sqrt{n+1}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}}\\
={}&\frac{2}{\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{n+1}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}}
\end{align*} 
Which leads to
 \begin{align*}
0\le x_n-x_{n+1}\le\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}},
\end{align*} 
And this immediately leads to
 $$
|x_m-x_n|\le\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}<\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},\qquad (\text{supposing}\ m>n)
$$ 
So I can simply let  $N=\left[\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\right]+1$ , thus  $|x_n-x_m|<\epsilon$ . Thanks again to everyone commented below.

"This question is a follow-up to  Expected number of steps for reaching a specific absorbing state in an absorbing Markov chain   because I don't understand the answer given there.  I think I need to see a concrete example.   
 Suppose I play red and black at a casino.  On each play, I either win the amount I staked, with probability $p<\frac12$ or I lose my stake.  Let's say I start with a bankroll of $2$ and I decide to play until I have won $3$ or lost everything.  My strategy is to bet just enough to reach my goal, or everything I have, whichever is less. 
 We have a Markov chain with $6$ states, $2$ of which are absorbing.  There are well-known methods to determine the probability of winning, and of determining the average number of plays I make, but what if I want to know the average number of plays I make if I reach my goal?  The transition matrix, with $q=1-p$ is $$\begin {bmatrix} 
1&0&0&0&0&0\\
q&0&p&0&0&0\\
q&0&0&0&p&0\\
0&q&0&0&0&p\\
0&0&0&q&0&p\\
0&0&0&0&0&1
\end{bmatrix}$$ 
 Henning Malcolm suggests two approaches, neither of which I can follow.  (This is because of my limitations, and is in no way intended as a criticism of the answer.)  The first assumes that I have figured out the probability of winning starting with every possible bankroll.  Then we are to compute new transition probabilities that describe the experience of the winners, as I understand it, and compute the time to absorption in the new chain.  Let $p_k$ be the probability of winning, if my bankroll is $k$.  How should I calculate the new transition matrix? 
 Henning Malcolm gives an alternative method if there is only one starting state we're interested in, and I'm only interested in the actual case where I start in state $2$.  He says, ""first set up a system of equations that compute for each state the expected number of times one will encounter that state before being absorbed.""  If we let $e_k$ be this number for state $k=1,2,3,4,$ how do we construct the equations relating the $e_k?$  I can see how to do this if we only care about the number plays until the game ends, but how do I make it reflect only the number of plays until winning?

"This is very much an applied maths question. I'm having trouble with  Euler angles  in the context of  smartphone apps .  I've been working with  Android , but I would guess that the same problem arises whatever operating system one uses. 
 In the context of it's 3D sensors, the Android operating system is set up to calculate a rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ which is defined by 
 $$
\mathbf{R}=\left[
\begin{array}
[c]{ccc}%
E_{x} & E_{y} & E_{z}\\
N_{x} & N_{y} & N_{z}\\
G_{x} & G_{y} & G_{z}%
\end{array}
\right]
$$ 
 where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are axes relative to the smartphone, 
 
 and where 
 $$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{E}  & = \left( E_{x},E_{y},E_{z}\right) =\text{a unit vector
which points East}\\
\mathbf{N}  & = \left( N_{x},N_{y},N_{z}\right) =\text{a unit vector
which points North}\\
\mathbf{G}  & = \left( G_{x},G_{y},G_{z}\right) =
\begin{array}
[c]{l}%
\text{a unit vector which points away from}\\
\text{the centre of the earth (Gravity vector)}
\end{array}
\text{  .}
\end{align*}
$$ 
 Once $\mathbf{R}$ has been calculated, the Android operating system will then calculate for you the  Euler angles  $\phi$, $\theta$ and $\psi$ where 
 $$
\begin{array}
[c]{lll}%
\text{azimuth} & =\phi & =\text{rotation about }\mathbf{G}\\
\text{pitch} & =\theta & =\text{rotation about }\mathbf{E}\\
\text{roll} & =\psi & =\text{rotation about }\mathbf{N}
\end{array}
\text{  .}
$$ 
 The relationship between $\mathbf{R}$ and $(\phi$, $\theta$, $\psi)$ is given by 
 $$
\mathbf{R}=\left[
\begin{array}
[c]{ccc}%
\cos\phi\cos\psi-\sin\phi\sin\psi\sin\theta & \sin\phi\cos\theta & \cos
\phi\sin\psi+\sin\phi\cos\psi\sin\theta\\
-\sin\phi\cos\psi-\cos\phi\sin\psi\sin\theta & \cos\phi\cos\theta & -\sin
\phi\sin\psi+\cos\phi\cos\psi\sin\theta\\
-\sin\psi\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & \cos\psi\cos\theta
\end{array}
\right]  \text{  .}
$$ 
 The azimuth $\phi$ is a particularly important result, because $\phi=0$ corresponds to the direction of north. However, there is a well known problem with these Euler angles, which is known as  Gimbal lock .  When $\theta=\pm\frac{\pi}{2}$ the co-ordinate system is denerate in the sense that the combination $\phi\pm\psi$ is defined, but the individual quantities $\phi$ and $\psi$ are not defined. 
 In the context of smartphone apps, this means that determining the direction of north is tricky when the device isn't lying flat on a table.  The closer the device gets to being upright, the less reliable to co-ordinate system becomes. On  stackoverflow.com  some people recommend switching axes when $\theta$ moves away from $0$ so as to avoid Gimbal lock, but I find that that solution introduces other problems, such as jumps in $\phi$, $\theta$ and $\psi$ when the coordinate system is switched. 
 So my question is, instead of $\phi$, $\theta$ and $\psi$ as defined above, is there a better way of defining an angular co-ordinate system for expressing the orientation of a smartfone relative to the vectors $\mathbf{E}$, $\mathbf{N}$ and $\mathbf{G}$?  In particular, is there a coordinate system that's better for defining the direction of north, that will work whether the device is upright or lying flat on a table. 
 Clarification  Whatever the best methodology is, one result must be some kind of azimuth angle which can be explicitly calculated from the rotation matrix $R$, which represents the angle through which the device must be rotated so that it's pointing north.

 1) Triangles ACE and BCD are similar.  BD is parallel to AE. 
 AE is 10cm , BD is 6CM , AC is 7CM. 
 
 Calculate the length of BC 
 I'm having massive issues with this question, and don't know where to start.  Are you able to give me a worked formula?   
 2) The sketch below shows an ice cream cone of a radius of 4cm and depth of 12cm in which there is a sphere of ice cream of radius 2.5cm.  The ice cream melts and runs into the base of the cone.  Find the depth of the liquid ice cream when this has happened.   YOU MUST USE THE SIMILAR SHAPES METHOD 
 
 This is what my understanding is so far. 
 We first calculate the volume of the ice cream sphere.  So $\frac {4} {3} \times π \times r^2.
Therefore,\frac {4} {3} \times π \times 2.5 \times 2.5 = 26.18cm^3$. 
 Then we calculate the volume of the cone, = $201.06cm^3$. 
 How would we go about finding the depth?

 Find  $U + W$  and  $U \cap W$  for  $U =\{\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\x_3\\x_4\\x_5\end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^5 | \left\{\begin{array}{l}x_2=2x_1-x_3\\x_4=3x_5\end{array}\right.  \}$ ,  $W=\{\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\x_3\\x_4\\x_5\end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^5 | x_3+x_4=0 \}.$ 
 
 So I found out that:

"Problem: 
 Draw the curve for  $y = H(x), x \in \mathbb{R}$  where 
 $$H(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x}{t^2 + x^2} dt$$ 
 Attempted solution: 
 The hint I have been given is to first calculate the integral for  $x>0$ , then use the result to get  $H(x)$  even for negative  $x$ . 
 I assume that this could just be integrated without much effort (variable substitution with  $u = t^2 + x^2$  and  $du = 2x~dx$ ): 
 $$H(x) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x}{t^2 + x^2} dt = \Big[\frac{1}{2} \ln(t^2 + x^2) \Big]_0^\infty$$ 
 (Here I am assuming that  $t$  is just a constant.) 
 However, this seems to diverge. So it is unclear how I can get from a divergent integral to the function. 
 The expected solution is that: 
 $H(x) = \pi, x > 0 $ 
 $H(x) = 0, x = 0 $ 
 $H(x) = -\pi, x < 0 $ 
 Why does this approach does not work? What are some other productive calculus-based approaches (cannot be more difficult than basic single variable calculus)?

 My attempt: If we accept that $S_n$ is convergent then by multiplying each sides by $a^\frac1n$ have:
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}n(a^\frac 1n-1)S_n=n\frac{-a^\frac 1n}{n+1}+na^\frac 2n(\frac{1}{n+1}-\frac{1}{n+\frac 12})+...+na^\frac nn(\frac1{n+\frac 1n}-\frac 1{n+\frac 1{n-1}})+n\frac{a^\frac{n+1}n}{n+\frac 1n}$$

 My answer : 
 The boundary of $S$ is simply the unit circle $x^2+y^2 = 1$ at height $z=1$. 
 A parametrization of $\partial S$ would be $r(\theta) = (\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta), 1)$, as $\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\pi$. 
 This is because the normal is facing outwards I believe, so for $\partial S$ to be positively oriented, $\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\pi$. 
 Calculating, we get $$\int_{\partial S}\vec{F}ds = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\vec{F}(r(\theta)) \cdot\nabla r(\theta)d\theta = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\cos^2(\theta)-\sin^3(\theta)d\theta = \pi$$ 
 However, the correct answer seems to be $-\pi$, so I got the orientation wrong, but I'm not sure why.

"The question is 
 
 The price of a mobile phone is $8800  inclusive  of a 10% GST (General
  Sales Tax). What is the original price of the mobile phone? 
 
 This is how I approached it: 
 The Sale Price  SP  of the phone, i.e. it's Original Price  OP  (sale price excluding GST)  +  GST on it, is $8800: 
 SP = OP + GST ---(1)
 
 But we don't have the GST, we only have it's percentage. So let's calculate out GST from the percentage/rate: 
    GST-in-Percentage = (GST / SP) * 100
=>                10 = (GST / 8800) * 100
=>               GST = 880
 
 Now, putting values in (1): 
    8800 = OP + 880
=>   OP = 8800 - 880
=>   OP = 7920
 
 
 Note: I have seen it again and again, but I can't see anything wrong with the approach. But this is how they did it: 
 Price of the mobile = 8800
GST rate = 10%
Original Price=?
Price percent of the mobile = 100% + 10%;

By using Unitary method, 

110% price = $8800
    1% price = (8800 / 110)
    100% price = (8800 / 110) * 100 = $8000

So the original price is $8000.

"This is something I stumbled upon a few years back, and has a geometrically intuitive explanation, as well as being useful in summing powers of integers. However, with some occasional attempts at an inductive proof, nothing's quite worked. This came from looking at the staircase pattern the sum of powers makes visually. For example, when  $k = 2$ ,  $\sum_{i=0}^n i^2$  directly sums the square layers making up a quarter pyramid, while  $\sum_{i=0}^n (n-i)((i+1)^2-i^2) = \sum_{i=0}^n (n-i)(2i-1)$  breaks up each layer into nested pairs of edges, with  $2i+1$  being the volume of the edges, and  $n-i$  being the number of edges of that size. You can use this to calculate, for example,  $\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \sum_{i=0}^n (n-i)(2i+1) = (2n-1)\sum_{i=0}^n i - 2\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 + n\sum_{i=0}^n 1$ , which then rearranges to the well-known  $\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(2n+1)n(n+1)}{6}$ , substituting  $\sum_{i=0}^n 1 = n+1$  and  $\sum_{i=0}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ . Can anyone see a way to prove the formula, or know how to, as I'd be rather surprised if this was a brand-new result, given how visually straight forward it is?

"While trying to find a lower limit for the number of twin primes I noticed the problem of having to compensate for duplicates. Once I overcame this problem the duplicates of the duplicates became a problem and I saw this was leading nowhere. So I came up with a different approach. I noticed this behavior is similar to sieving primes. After further analyzing it even seems likely that twin sieving is actually sieving primes over the results. This is also not easy to calculate so I decided to simplify to an lower limit.
I shifted the result of the first sieve together so that they form one continuous sequence of sieved numbers. Then it became much easier to calculate the number because this is $\pi(\pi(n))$.
The results for n up to $10^{18}$ are very promising , so my conjecture is that for large enough n:
\begin{align*}
\pi_2(n) &> \pi(\pi(n))
&f=\frac{\pi_2(n)}{\pi(\pi(n))} > 1\\

 For small $n$ $f<1$ because for small n the shifting actually causes less sieving. 
For n=3541  $\pi(\pi(n))$ and $\pi_2(n)$ are both 94, $f=1$) 
 After that $f>1$ because primes are far enough apart that the shifting reduces the count. 
 
 Proof:
  We determine the number of twin primes by first counting the number of primes that are $6n-1$ then we check the results for $6n+1$ also being a prime number. The first step is obtained by sieving for primes and dividing this by 2 which gives us: $$\frac{\pi(n)}{2}$$ 
  There are more $6n-1$ primes so this slightly lower than the actual count.
  Then we start eliminating all $6n+1$ that are not prime:
  We need to remove all $6n+1$ that are 5 multiples: $25+5 \cdot 6x$ next all 7 multiples etc. This is the same as sieving for primes with the exception that 2 and 3 are not used. This proofs sieving for twin primes gives the same result as sieving for primes twice with the exception of 3 for the second pass (2 was necessary because we needed  $\frac{\pi(n)}{2}$.
  Even with a crude compensation for sieving 3 the result is a much better lower limit, even much better than Hardy-Littlewood. 
 
 
 
 Questions: 
 
 
 $f$ seems to converge, it increases less with every decade. Is this true and is it possible to predict a value for $f \lim_{n \to \infty}\\ \\$ 
 As $f$ only seems to grow for large $n$, this conjecture makes infinitely many twin primes very likely but is it possible to turn it into a proof?

"Until now I was using the elementary row operations to do the gaussian elimination or to calculate the inverse of a matrix.
As I started learning Laplace's transformation to calculate the determinant of a $n \times n$ matrix, I noticed that the book uses elementary column operations.

 So why do column operations work for some operations and others not? How do you know when to use the column operations?

 $$f_{\varphi}(x)=
\begin{cases}
 \varphi x^{\varphi - 1} &\text{if}\, 0 < x < 1, \varphi > 0\\
      0 &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$ 
 I want to show that  $f_\varphi(x)$  is a member of the one-parameter exponential family. Furthermore, I want to show that  $\sum_{i = 1}^n - \log(X_i)$  is sufficient for  $\varphi$ . 
 Chapter  9.13.3 Exponential Families  of the textbook  All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference  by Larry Wasserman says the following: 
 
 Most of the parametric models we have studied so far are special cases of a general class of models called exponential families. We say that  $\{ f(x; \theta) : \theta \in \Theta \}$  is a  one-parameter exponential family  if there are functions  $\eta(\theta)$ ,  $B(\theta)$ ,  $T(x)$  and  $h(x)$  such that
 $$f(x; \theta) = h(x) e^{\eta(\theta) T(x) - B(\theta)}.$$ 
It is easy to see that  $T(x)$  is sufficient. We call  $T$  the  natural sufficient statistic . 
 
 I calculate the likelihood to be 
 $$\begin{align} L(\varphi; \mathbf{x}) &= \prod_{i = 1}^n \varphi x_i^{\varphi - 1} \mathbb{1}_{0 < x < 1, \varphi > 0} \\ &= \varphi^n x^{\sum_{i = 1}^n (\varphi - 1)} \prod_{i = 1}^n \mathbb{1}_{0 < x_i < 1, \varphi > 0} \\ &= \varphi^n x^{\sum_{i = 1}^n (\varphi - 1)} \mathbb{1}_{\text{min}(x_i) > 0, \varphi > 0} \end{align}$$ 
 To get this in the appropriate form, I tried 
 $$\begin{align} \log\left[\varphi^n x^{\sum_{i = 1}^n (\varphi - 1)} \mathbb{1}_{\text{min}(x_i) > 0, \varphi > 0} \right] &= n\log(\varphi) + \sum_{i = 1}^n (\varphi - 1) \log(x_i) + \log \left[ \mathbb{1}_{\text{min}(x_i) > 0, \varphi > 0} \right] \\&= \exp{ \left\{ n\log(\varphi) + (\varphi - 1) \sum_{i = 1}^n \log(x_i) + \log \left[ \mathbb{1}_{\text{min}(x_i) > 0, \varphi > 0} \right] \right\} } \\ &= \exp{ \left\{ n\log(\varphi) + (\varphi - 1) \sum_{i = 1}^n \log(x_i) \right\} } \exp{\left\{ \log \left[ \mathbb{1}_{\text{min}(x_i) > 0, \varphi > 0} \right] \right\}} \\ &= \exp{ \left\{ n\log(\varphi) + (\varphi - 1) \sum_{i = 1}^n \log(x_i) \right\} } \mathbb{1}_{\text{min}(x_i) > 0, \varphi > 0} \end{align}$$ 
 And we then select 
 $$\begin{align} &\eta(\varphi) = ? \\  &T(\mathbf{x}) = ? \\ &B(\varphi) = ? \\ &h(\mathbf{x}) = ? \end{align}$$ 
 I'm unsure how much of this is correct. The first thing that might be problematic is  $\log \left[ \mathbb{1}_{\text{min}(x_i) > 0, \varphi > 0} \right]$ . Specifically, I'm not sure that it's valid to log this identity matrix in the first place, but I'm not sure what else to do. As you can see, I later use an exponential to cancel out the log, but, as I said, I'm not sure that it was mathematically valid to apply log to it in the first place. The second is that I needed to show that  $\sum_{i = 1}^n - \log(X_i)$  is sufficient for  $\varphi$ , but I'm not sure how to further factorize the final expression in order to get this. 
 Another issue is that I cannot find any definitions or theorems for this in this chapter. There's usually a theorem that formally and explicitly states what you need to do/show in order show something (in this case, showing that  $f_\varphi(x)$  is a member of the one-parameter exponential family and that  $\sum_{i = 1}^n - \log(X_i)$  is sufficient for  $\varphi$ ). The excerpt that I posted above was simply part of the normal discussion of the chapter at the very beginning. Based on that, I presumed that, for showing that  $f_\varphi(x)$  is a member of the one-parameter family, I just have to show that the likelihood can take the form  $f(x; \theta) = h(x) e^{\eta(\theta) T(x) - B(\theta)}$ . However, for the sufficient statistic part, it just says that ""it is easy to see that  $T(x)$  is sufficient"", so I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to do with this (do I need to use the Fisher-Neyman factorization theorem, or does the exponential family form imply that  $T(\mathbf{x})$  is sufficient, and so we don't need to do anything else?). 
 So, overall, what is the correct way to do this to show that  $f_\varphi(x)$  is a member of the one-parameter exponential family and  $\sum_{i = 1}^n - \log(X_i)$  is sufficient for  $\varphi$ ?

$x$ is given and $x \in  \Bbb N$, we want to get $r$. 
This formula lets us calculate $x$ based off the row and coloumn number. 
$$2^rc+2^{r-1}=x,\; r \in \Bbb N,\; c \in \Bbb N,\; x \in \Bbb N$$ 
 
 False part start 
 solving this equation for $c$ gives us the following equation:
$$2^{-r}x-\frac{1}{2}=c$$
If we insert this for c in our original equation we get
$$2^r(2^{-r}x-\frac{1}{2})+2^{r-1}=x$$ 
 
 False part end 
 The part where I'm struggling is to solve this equation for $r$, so I can insert $x$ and get $r$. 
I hope somebody can help me with this... 
 Edit: the equation I made is stupid.
If you were able to follow my thoughts you might got what I'm trying to achieve. 
 Any help is appreciated :-)

"The  Elo rating system  is used to rank players in games such as chess. I can find plenty of explanations online of  how to compute  someone's Elo rating, how to actually crunch the numbers in practice, but I can't find a single clear conceptual explanation of what the rating is supposed to mean and why. 
 The only information I can find is that apparently the Elo rating of two players allows you to calculate the odds that one player will win against the other. But every page I've been able to find that talks about this just drops the formula for how to calculate these odds on you and says ""there you go, that gives the probability of winning"", without explaining  why . Wikipedia mentions something about the assumption that ""chess performance is normally distributed"", but doesn't go any further. 
 What is the underlying probabilistic model for two-player games that the Elo system is based on? What are its basic assumptions, and what is the proof, from those assumptions, that the Elo system does indeed allow you to calculate win probabilities?

Let  $S$  be the sum of (the numbers written on) the two cards drawn and let  $N$  be the number of green cards
drawn.

 $\textbf{My attempt}:$  The sample space is  $\Omega = \{\{12\},\{13\},\{23\},\{21\},\{31\},\{32\},\{GG\},\{GB\},\{BG\}\}$ . The  $\sigma-$ algebra will be the  $\sigma-$ algebra generated by this  $\Omega$ .  
 $\textbf{Part b})$  What is the  $\sigma-$ algebra of events generated by  $S$ ? 
 $\textbf{My attempt}:$  The sample space is  $\Omega = \{3,4,5\}$ . So,  $\sigma(S) = \{\phi, \Omega, \{3\},\{4\},\{5\}\} = \{\phi, \Omega, \{12,21\}, \{13,22,31\}, \{23,32\}\}$ .

 $\textbf{Part d})$  Is  $S$  measurable with respect to  $\sigma(N)$ ? 
 $\textbf{My attempt}:$  No, S is not measurable with to  $\sigma(N)$ . This is because the information about the number of green cards does not give us all the information about the sum of the cards. For example, if the number of green cards are 1, the both the sums of  $4$  and  $5$  are possible.  
 $\textbf{Part e})$  Is  $N$  measurable with respect to  $\sigma(S)$ ?

So I excuse in advance if this question feel silly;
Also please delete/close it if this doesn't fit the site policy. 
 For example, considering only one variable to calculate the probability of the birth of a person: 
 
 the probability of one particuliar spermatozoon to penetrate the ovum. 
 
 As there is about 250 millions spermatazoons per ejaculation, that give roughly 1 chance on 250 millions that a particular spermatozoon reaches the egg. 
Taking the last 2000 years and considering a generation is about 20 years,
the probability one person is born considering only the spermatozoons variable is: 
 250 000 000^100 
 So that means if we are standing at year 0, there is 1 chance on 6.22E+839 that a particuliar human, like you or me, is born 2000 years later (and this only taking one variable and a small generation number in consideration). 
 So probability speaking, this event is very unlikely to happen, but it happened for every human on the planet. 
Looking only at the numbers, it feel paradoxal that a such low probability is happening with a 100% chance.  
 It might be ""cheating"" to take a event and calculate the probabilities of causes that might have led to this result,
anyway I would like to get mathematicians views on this paradox. 
 Sidenotes: 
To put the question in more theoric terms, probability implies non-determinism, but causality imply determinism. 
The law of physics suggesting causality of the world at some extend (skipping quantum physics here), a non determistic approach (probabilistic) of a determinist system can lead to paradoxal results, eg every living human on earth has a lower probability than 1 on 6.22E+839 to be born as he/she is. 
 ps: If considering the world including future events to be deterministic is problematic, we can admit that the past, as being finished and generated only one present outcome, as a deterministic system.

 $$4x^2 +xy \geq 4x^2+x|y|=2x^2 (2-\sqrt{1-(x/a)^2 })>0 $$  therefore  $4x^2 +xy$  is continue in  $D$  and we can integrate it. 
 So now we take
 $$\begin{align}
& \int_{-2x \sqrt{1-(x/a)^2 } }^{  2x \sqrt{1-(x/a)^2 } } x \sqrt{4x^2 +xy}\,dy\\
=&\left(4x^2+x\left(2x\sqrt{1-(x/a)^2 }\right) \right)^{\!3/2} - \left(4x^2 +x\left(2x \sqrt{1-(x/a)^2 } \right)\right)^{\!3/2}.
\end{align}$$ 
So the following is let  $x=a\cos(t)$  and integrate respect  $t$ , so I  say now that  $t\in [-\pi/2,\pi/2] $ .
But when I integrate it,work not simplify.
Any help is very helpful.

"Those are the only coordinate systems that I've heard of. Clearly we can invent other coordinate systems that have the two properties 
 a) All points in Euclidean space are represented by the system (surjectivity). 
 b) A point in Euclidean space cannot be represented in two or more different ways by the system (injectivity). 
 To take an example of such a coordinate system, I thought of this: Say that for any point $p$ in Euclidean space with Cartesian coordinates $(x_1,y_1)$, we associate it with a square with a center in the origin whose side length is $s=2 \cdot |\max(x_1,y_1)|$. Then starting at the point with Cartesian coordinates $(s,0)$, we travel on the square in a counterclockwise way until we find $p$, then calculate the distance $d$ that we have traveled. Using this coordinate system, we can say that the coordinate is expressed as $(s/2,d)$. Hence, the points $(3,2)$ and $(-4,9)$ in Cartesian coordinates would have the coordinates $(3,2)$ and $(9,22)$ respectively using this system. Clearly this coordinate system satisfies the above properties (it just uses squares instead of the circles in the polar coordinate system), but I can't think of a situation where it would be useful. So back to my question, do there exist any coordinate systems besides the Cartesian and polar ones that are useful for some situations (for some problems maybe or applications)?

 The angle between the unit vectors $u$ and $v$ is $30º$, and the vector $w$ of norm $4$ is ortogonal to both $u,v$. The basis $(u,v,w)$ is positive, calculate $[u,v,w]$. 
 
 I did the following: 
 
 Take an arbitrary vector of norm $1$, for simplicity I took $u=(1,0,0)$. 
 Now I need another vector $v$ with norm $1$ and $30$ degrees from $u$. To do it, I solved the following pait of equations: 
 
 $$\frac{(1,0,0)\cdot(x,y,z)}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}=\frac{\pi}{6} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}=1$$ 
 
 For simplicity, I took this vector from the  $xy$ plane, that means that $z=0$. Then: 
 
 $$\frac{(1,0,0)\cdot(x,y,0)}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}=\frac{\pi}{6} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \sqrt{x^2+y^2}=1$$ 
 The solutions are: 
 $$\begin{array}{cc}
 x_1: \frac{\pi }{6} & y_1: -\frac{1}{6} \sqrt{36-\pi ^2} \\
 x_2: \frac{\pi }{6} & y_2: \frac{\sqrt{36-\pi ^2}}{6} \\
\end{array}$$ 
 
 Now to get a vector that is perpendicular to $u,v$, I could use the cross product, but for these two vector, it's pretty easy to figure out I can use $w=(0,0,4)$. 
 Now to calculate $[u,v,w]$, I used the following determinants: 
 
 $$\
\begin{vmatrix}
 0 & 0 & 4 \\
 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 \frac{\pi }{6} & -\frac{1}{6} \sqrt{36-\pi ^2} & 0 \\
\end{vmatrix}=-\frac{2}{3} \sqrt{36-\pi ^2} \quad \quad \quad  \begin{vmatrix}
 0 & 0 & 4 \\
 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 \frac{\pi }{6} & \frac{\sqrt{36-\pi ^2}}{6} & 0 \\
\end{vmatrix}=\frac{2 \sqrt{36-\pi ^2}}{3}$$

"In a paper about  Prime Number Races , I found the following (page 14 and 19): 
 
 This formula, while
  widely believed to be correct, has not yet been proved.
  $$
\frac{\int\limits_2^x{\frac{dt}{\ln t}} - \# \{\text{primes}\le
x\} }
{\sqrt x/\ln x} \approx 1 + 2\sum_{\gamma} \ \ \frac{\sin(\gamma\ln x)}{\gamma}, 
\tag{3}
$$
  with $\gamma$ being imaginary part of the roots of the $\zeta$ function. 
 $\dots$ 
 For example, if the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis is
  true for the function $L(s)$ just defined, then we get the formula
  $$
\frac{\#\{\text{primes}\ 4n+3 \le x\} - \#\{\text{primes}\ 4n+1
\le x\}} {\sqrt x/\ln x} \approx 1 + 2\sum_{\gamma^\prime} 
\frac{\sin(\gamma^\prime\ln x)}{\gamma^\prime}, \tag{4'}
$$
  with $\gamma^\prime$ being imaginary part of the roots of the Dirichlet $L$-function associated to the race between primes of
  the form $4n+3$ and primes of the form $4n+1$, which is
  $$
L(s) = \frac1{1^s} - \frac1{3^s} + \frac1{5^s} - \frac1{7^s} + \dots.
$$ 
 
 
 Since 
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\# \{\text{primes}\le x\} &=&\# \{\text{primes}\ 4n+3 \le x\} + \#\{\text{primes}\ 4n+1\le x\}\\
&\approx& \text{Li}(x)- \left(\sqrt x/\ln x\right) \left(1 + 2\sum_{\gamma} \ \ \frac{\sin(\gamma\ln x)}{\gamma} \right)
\end{eqnarray}
$$
and assuming the (Generalized) Riemann Hypothesis to be true, is it valid to calculate
$$ 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \# \{\text{primes}\ 4n+3 \le x\} &\approx& \frac{\text{Li}(x)}{2} &-& \frac{\left(\sqrt x/\ln x\right)}{2} \left(1 + 2\sum_{\gamma} \ \ \frac{\sin(\gamma\ln x)}{\gamma} \right)\\
&&&+& \frac{\left(\sqrt x/\ln x\right)}{2} \left( 1 + 2\sum_{\gamma^\prime} 
\frac{\sin(\gamma^\prime\ln x)}{\gamma^\prime} \right)\\
&\approx& \frac{\text{Li}(x)}{2} &+&  \left(\sqrt x/\ln x\right) \left(\sum_{\gamma^\prime} 
\frac{\sin(\gamma^\prime\ln x)}{\gamma^\prime} -\sum_{\gamma} \ \ \frac{\sin(\gamma\ln x)}{\gamma} \right),
\end{eqnarray}
$$ 
or do the error terms spoil the calculation? 
 Is there another way to get $\# \{\text{primes}\ 4n+3 \le x\}$ using a different Dirichlet $L$-function? How does it look like? Is it possible to treat the general case of $\# \{\text{primes}\ kn+m \le x\}$ the same way?  
 
 EDIT  From the wiki page on  Generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH) , I get: 
 
 Dirichlet's theorem states that if a and d are coprime natural numbers, then the arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, … contains infinitely many prime numbers. Let π(x,a,d) denote the number of prime numbers in this progression which are less than or equal to x. If the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, then for every coprime a and d and for every ε > 0
  $$
    \pi(x,a,d) = \frac{1}{\varphi(d)} \int_2^x \frac{1}{\ln t}\,dt + O(x^{1/2+\epsilon})\quad\mbox{ as } \ x\to\infty 
$$
  where φ(d) is Euler's totient function and O is the Big O notation. This is a considerable strengthening of the prime number theorem. 
 
 So my example would look like 
$$
\pi(x,3,4) = \frac{1}{\varphi(4)}\text{Li}(x) + O(x^{1/2+\epsilon}),
$$
(something that already ask/answered here:  Distribution of Subsets of Primes ). So the part with the roots seems to be burried in $O(x^{1/2+\epsilon})$, since $\varphi(4)=2$.

"Let me ask right at the start:  what is Riemann integration really used for ? 
 As far as I'm aware, we use Lebesgue integration in: 
 
 probability theory 
 theory of PDE's 
 Fourier transforms 
 
 and really, anywhere I can think of where integration is used (perhaps in the form of Haar measure, as a generalization, although I'm sure this is vastly incomplete picture). 
 Let me state a well known theorem: 
 
 Let $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$ be bounded function. Then: 
 (i)  $f$ is Riemann-integrable if and only if $f$ is continuous almost everywhere on $[a,b]$ (with respect to Lebesgue measure). 
 (ii)  If $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[a,b]$, then $f$ is Lebesgue-integrable and Riemann and Lebesgue integrals coincide. 
 
 (I will try to be fair, we use this result and Riemann integration to calculate many Lebesgue integrals) 
 From this we can conclude that Riemann-integrability is a stronger condition and we might naively conclude that it might behave better. However it does not; Riemann integral does not well behave under limits, while Lebesgue integral does: we have Lebesgue monotone and dominated convergence theorems. 
 Furthermore, I'm not aware of any universal property of Riemann integration, while in contrast we have  this  result presented by Tom Leinster; it establishes Lebesgue integration as initial in appropriate category (category of Banach spaces with mean). 
 Also, I'm familiar with Lebesgue-Stiltjes integral, greatly used for example in probability theory to define appropriate measures. I'm not so familiar with the concept or usage of Riemann-Stiltjes integral, and I'd greatly appreciate if someone could provide any comparison. 
 As far as I can tell, the only accomplishment of Riemann integration is the Fundamental theorem of calculus (not to neglect it's importance). I'm very interested to know if there are more important results. 
 To summarize the question: 
 Where is Riemann integral used compared to Lebesgue integral (which seems much better behaved) and why do we care? 
 Update: 
 It seems that it is agreed upon that Riemann integration primarily serves didactical purpose in teaching introductionary courses in analysis as a stepping stone for Lebesgue integration in later courses when measure theory is introduced. Also, improper integrals were brought as an example of something Lebesgue integration doesn't handle well. However, in several answers and comments we have another notion - that of a gauge integral (Henstock–Kurzweil integral, (narrow) Denjoy integral, Luzin integral or Perron integral). This integral not only generalizes both Riemann and Lebesgue integration, but also has much more satisfactory Fundamental theorem of calculus: if a function is a.e. differentiable than it's differential is gauge-integrable and conversely function defined by gauge integral is a.e. differentiable (here almost everywhere means everywhere up to a countable set).

"Let $a,b$ be fixed complex numbers and let $L$ be the line
$$L=\{a+bt:t\in\Bbb R\}.$$
Let $w\in\Bbb C\setminus L$. Let's calculate $$d(w,L)=\inf\{|w-z|:z\in L\}=\inf_{t\in\Bbb R}|w-(a+bt)|.$$
The first observation is
$$d(w,L)=\inf_{t\in\Bbb R}|w-(a+bt)|=\inf_{t\in\Bbb R}|(w-a)-bt|=d(w-a,L-a).$$
So without loss of generality we can assume that $a=0$, so
$$L=b\Bbb R.$$
And then, let's assume that $|b|=1$. 
 Assume
$$b=x+iy,\qquad x,y\in\Bbb R,$$
and let
$$b'=y-ix.$$
so that $b'\bar{b}$ is purely imaginary and $|b'|=|b|=1$. 
 Consider the line
$$L'=w+b'\Bbb R.$$
Then $L$ and $L'$ are orthogonal and since $w=w+b'\cdot 0$ we get $w\in L'$. Let $w'$ the point in which these lines meet. Let's calculate it
$$\begin{align*}
w+b's &= bs\\
s &= \frac{w}{b-b'}.
\end{align*}$$
so $w'=w+b's$. The distance $d(w,L)$ must be achieved at $w'$ (because $L'$ is the perpendicular line to $L$ through $w$), so
$$d(w,L)=|w-w'|=|b's|=1|s|=\left|\frac{w}{b-b'}\right|=\frac{|w|}{|b-b'|}.$$
Let's compute $|b-b'|$
$$|b-b'|^2=|x+iy-(y-ix)|^2=(x-y)^2+(x+y)^2=2|b|^2=2$$
therefore
$$d(w,L)=\frac{|w|}{\sqrt{2}}.$$

"This question came about when I was with a group of 8 friends (i.e. 9 in total), and we realised we all had birthdays in distinct months - we tried to work out the probability of this happening. The 2 answers we came up with seemed either too remote or too common: 
 The probability that I have a birthday in any given month is $\frac{1}{12}$, and so the probability that all the other people have birthdays in a different month is $\frac{8}{11}$; adding these together and multiplying by the number of people: 
 $ (\frac{1}{12} + \frac{8}{11})^9 $ 
 gives 0.15 - which seems too big (and I've realised can't be correct because it gives an impossible answer when the number of friends is >11)

 $\frac{1}{12} * \frac{1}{11} * \frac{1}{10} * \frac{1}{9} * \frac{1}{8} * \frac{1}{7} * \frac{1}{6} * \frac{1}{5} * \frac{1}{4}$

"PROBLEM STATEMENT:  Consider the following 2-variable linear regression where the error $e_i$ 's are
independently and identically distributed with mean $0$ and variance $1$; 
 $$y_i = α + β(x_i − \bar x) + e_i ,\ i = 1,2,...,n.$$ 
 Let $\hat α$ and $ \hat β$ be ordinary least squares estimates of $α$ and $β$ respectively. What is the correlation coefficient between $\hat α$ and $\hat β$? 
 
 MY ATTEMPT:  I use the standard optimization technique to minimize the sum of squares of the error terms. By differentiating by $\alpha$ and $\beta$, I find $$\hat \alpha = \bar y,\ \hat \beta = \frac{\sum x_iy_i-n\bar x\bar y}{\sum x_i^2 - n\bar x^2}.$$
I am stuck here. How do I use the fact that $e_i$'s are i.i.d in order to find the correlation coefficient between $\hat \alpha$ and $\hat \beta$?
Firstly, I do not think I understand the problem correctly. In order to calculate the correlation coefficient, I must have a set of values of $\hat \alpha$s and $\hat \beta$s. The $e_i$'s are i.i.d random variables each having mean $0$ and variance $1$. Based on the different values that the different $e_i$s take, I solve the minimization problem every time and find that $\hat \alpha$ and $\hat \beta$ are only dependent on $x_i,y_i$ as above and hence always the same. How then do I find the correlation coefficient? 
 I have knowledge of only the definitions of elementary terms in the topic of regression, and I am self-studying this. I am sure the problem must have a very easy solution as it is meant to be solved in a few minutes with an extremely elementary knowledge of statistics.

 In a casino in Monte Carlo, you play at a very peculiar machine. The machine has  $n$  wheels, each with  $k$  possible values (not necessarily distinct). The wheels may be different from each other, that is it does not necessarily hold that every wheel has the same  $k$  values on it. 
 When you activate the machine, each wheels lands in one of its  $k$  possible values chosen uniformly at random and independently of all other wheels. You win a jackpot if the  $n$  chosen values form an increasing sequence  $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \dots \leq x_n$  (the sequence does not need to be strictly increasing). You want to compute your chances of winning a jackpot. 
 
 
 My idea would have been to define the events:  $A_i = ``x_{i-1} \leq x_i""$ . So I have to calculate  $P[A_2 \& \dots \&A_N]$ . I'm not sure but  $P[A_i]$  must be:  $P[A_i] = (k-z)/k * (1/k)$  ( $z$  is the number that has been taken in  $x_{i-1}$ ). But how do I calculate this probability? Does any one also have an idea how to implement it in Java? The master solution uses recursion, but I didn't get that part.

 Wheel 1 has the values: 1, 2, 3
Wheel 2 has the values: 1, 2, 3

"What is the probability of all values appearing once when picking 2 random card values  n  times, knowing these 2 values are unique? 
 Here's an illustration: 
 Suppose you have a deck of  k  cards, ranging from  1  to  k , you pick  2  cards out, then record the values, and put them back You repeat this for  n-1  more times. What is the probability that by the end of  n  times looking through the cards, you have seen all card values from  1  to  k ? 
 The solution I got through  10,000,000  simulations were 42.19% where  n = 10  and  k = 9 . Though this is merely an estimate, and a formula would sort things out better for me. 
 The formula I use for calculating  1  picked card after  n  trials is 
 $$\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^k\binom{n}{k}\left(1-\frac kn\right)^r$$ 
 Is there anyway to inject this problem into the formula to figure out the probability of  2  picked cards instead of  1 ? If not, is there a formula to calculate the probability of it happening for  n  trials and  k  number of cards? 
 Edit:  Credits to  @awkward  for the solution to the question.
For good measures: I have compared the solutions of  n = 1...50  &  k = 9  to my simulations and they were almost complete matches. 
 In addition, this solution also works with  c  number of cards with some minor adjustments: 
 $$p_0 = 1 + \sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^j \binom{k}{j} \left( \frac{\binom{k-j}{c}}{\binom{k}{c}} \right)^n$$ 
 I have tested this through several simulations and it does match. I will update you when the computer finishes these new simulations. 
 Edit #2:  After finishing simulations, I can finally conclude with confidence that the formula works for  2  ≤  c  ≤  k  where  c  is the number of cards,  k  is the number of unique elements, and  n  is the number of trials performed.

"Currently I am trying to understand hypothesis testing, but I have a problem with the following question: 
 A casino owner is concerned based on past experience that his dice show
6 too often. He makes his employees roll a die 18,000 times and they observe
3,123 sixes. Is the die biased? 
 So from this text I used the following test:
$$ h0 := p = \frac{1}{6} = unbiased $$
$$ h1 := p \ne \frac{1}{6} = biased $$
The problem is that I don't how to calculate it. First I tried this formula:
$$ \frac{\hat x - \mu}{SE} $$
$$ SE= \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$ 
 $$ \frac{3123-3000}{\frac{\sqrt{18000\cdot\frac{3123}{18000}\cdot\frac{14874}{18000}}}{\sqrt{18000}}} = 0.018478$$ 
 Also I tried the following formula: 
 $$ \frac{\frac{3123}{18000} - \frac{3000}{18000}}{\sqrt{\frac{\frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{5}{6}}{18000}}} =2.46$$

"This is perhaps a vague question, but hopefully there exists literature on the subject. The question is motivated by an answer I gave to  this question . I also asked a related question on  MO , although hopefully this question should be easier. 
 There exists a rather remarkable relationship between the 5 platonic solids, and the factor groups of the $n$-string braid groups $B_n$ by adjoining the relation $\sigma_i^k=1$ (here the $\sigma_i$, $1\leq i\leq n-1$ are the usual generators of $B_n$). We'll call these groups $B_n(k)$ the truncated braid groups of type $(n,k)$ where $B_n(k)=B_n/\langle \sigma_i^k\rangle$. 
 
 Theorem  *: For $n\geq 3$, the group $B_n(k)$ is finite if and only if $k=2$ or $(n,k)$ is the  Schläfli type  of one of the 5 platonic solids. For these cases, $$|B_n(k)|=\left(\frac{f(n,k)}{2}\right)^{n-1}n!$$ where $f(n,k)$ is the number of faces of the platonic solid of type $(n,k).$ 
 
 The 5 platonic solids correspond to the pairs $(n,k)\in\{(3,3),(3,4),(4,3),(3,5),(5,3)\}$. This is equivalent to the pair $(n,k)$ being a solution to the inequality $$\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{k}>\frac{1}{2}.$$ 
 *It appears that this theorem was proved by Coxeter in 
 H. S. M. Coxeter,  Factor groups of the braid group , Proceedings of the Fourth Can. Math. Cong., Banff 1957, University of Toronto Press (1959), 95–122. 
 although it is proving difficult for me to find a copy of this online or in my institution's library. From what I can gather, the proof is rather algebraic/combinatorial, although without access to a copy I can't say for sure. My question is: 
 
 Question  Can one view the finite truncated braid groups in a geometric way as some action (in the vague, not necessarily strict group-action, sense) on the corresponding platonic solid or related objects? 
 
 Some of the approaches I have taken have included: 
 
 considering the isometry group on the corresponding solid (group orders don't match up), 
 considering paths on the surface which 'remember' the side that a face was entered from (relations don't match up), 
 considering labellings of the edges of the faces of the solid so that no face has a pair of edges with the same label, with group elements being permutations of edges which preserve this property (not sure if order matches up - seems difficult to calculate but may be the best approach so far), 
 considering 'rolling' the solid along a surface until it reaches its starting point again (no obvious way of making this a group via some kind of  homotopy ) 
 
 It seems that there should be some nice geometric interpretation of these groups, especially as every face has $n$ edges and every vertex is shared by $k$ faces. 
 It would be especially nice if the usual generators can be realised in a nice geometric way. Ultimately it would be nice to extend such a geometric interpretation of these finite truncated braid groups to the infinite cases as well (which correspond to regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane in most cases, and the complex plane in the case $(n,k)\in\{(3,6),(4,4),(6,3)\}$).

 I'm trying to make a physics simulator of magnets, magnetic interactions and such.
I've followed the formulas in Wikipedia pages, and some first results are great (same newton force value between math model and reality test). 
 Now I have to translate everything in a software coding; I'm using c# inside grasshopper inside Rhinoceros. 
 I can calculate the magnetic field vector ""B"" of a magnetic dipole vector ""m"" with this formula:  wiki 4  , 
 Pic 1 
 Anyway,
here:  wiki 1  , here:  wiki 2  and here:  wiki 3  it says that the force is this:
 Pic 2 
 That is the gradient of the dot product of ""m""(the magnetic dipole moment vector) and ""B""(the local magnetic field vector). 
 I've understood that the gradient is somehow ""like"" the slope of a function (which you can ""manually"" calculate by evaluating two points really close and divide their Y difference by their X distance). 
 For every sample point I'd like to have one gradient vector (of the local resulting magnetic field) to multiply (dot product) with whatever dipole is passing by in that iteration.
(Does this make sense? I'm not native English...) 
 Can I calculate the gradient by evaluating 2 points near the target location in the same way?

 $y(2) = y_0 + h * f'(x_o,y_0,y''_0) = 2+2*(2+0-1) = \color{blue}{4}$ 
 $y'(2) = y'_0 + h * f'(x_o,y_0,y''_0) = 1 + 2 *(2+0-1)  = \color{green}{3}$

"Problem Statement 
 At a certain electronics factory, in a typical day’s output 10% percent of resistors are bad, and the rest are
good. Good resistors have an 80% chance of passing the factory’s test, and bad resistors have a 30% chance
of passing the test. Suppose the factory tests each resistor three times. If a particular resistor passes the test
2 times out of 3, what are the chances it is good? 
 Solution 1 
 First, let's define some events:  
 $B :=$ resistor is bad, $G :=$ resistor is good 
 $P :=$ resistor passes one test, $F :=$ resistor fails one test 
 $Q :=$ resistor passes 2 out of 3 tests 
 From the problem statement, we can say that $P[B] = 0.10, P[G] = 0.90, P[P|G] = 0.80, P[P|B] = 0.30$. Since the tests are independent, we can also say that $P[Q|G] = {3 \choose 2}(0.8)^2(0.2)$ and that $P[Q|B] = {3 \choose 2}(0.3)^2(0.7)$. 
 The quantity we seek is $P[G|Q]$. We proceed using Bayes' theorem: 
 $$
\begin{align}
P[G|Q] &= \frac{P[Q|G]P[G]}{P[Q]}\\
&= \frac{P[Q|G]P[G]}{P[Q|G]P[G] + P[Q|B]P[B]}\\
&= \frac{{3 \choose 2}(0.8)^2(0.2)(0.9)}{{3 \choose 2}(0.8)^2(0.2){0.9} + {3 \choose 2}(0.3)^2(0.7)(0.1)}\\
&\approx 0.95
\end{align}
$$ 
 Solution 2 
 This solution is the same as solution 1, but we calculate $P[Q]$ differently. We can say that $P[P] = P[P|G]P[G] + P[P|B]P[B] = (0.8)(0.9) + (0.3)(0.1) = 0.75$. Since the tests are independent, $P[Q] = {3 \choose 2}(0.75)^2 (0.25)$. 
 We proceed using Bayes' theorem just like we did in solution 1: 
 $$
\begin{align}
P[G|Q] &= \frac{P[Q|G]P[G]}{P[Q]}\\
&= \frac{{3 \choose 2}(0.8)^2(0.2)(0.9)}{{3 \choose 2}(0.75)^2 (0.25)}\\
&\approx 0.82
\end{align}
$$

"If  $a^2+c^2>ab$  and  $b^2>4c^2$  , for real x, show that  $\frac{x+a}{x^2+bx+c^2}$  cannot lie between two limits

 $$y=\frac{x+a}{x^2+bx+c^2}$$ 
 $$yx^2+byx+yc^2=x+a$$ 
 $$yx^2+x(by-1)+yc^2-a=0$$

 I tried to use other methods, but I just can't understand them (like using $\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}$ as a replacement for $x, y$ and then other sequence, like $\frac{1}{n}, \frac{2}{n}$ to check if the limit is identical, but it just doesn't work here.

"Question: 
 
 My solution: Using the mid-point formula, we can easily prove that the coordinates of the point $M$ are $(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})$. After this, we can use the distance formula to compute the distance $BM$ & $MA$ as follows (I'm doing so in an equation instead of individually): 
 $\sqrt{(0 + \frac{a}{2})^2 + (b + \frac{b}{2})^2} = \sqrt{(a + \frac{a}{2})^2 + (0 + \frac{b}{2})^2}$ 
 $\implies (0 + \frac{a}{2})^2 + (b + \frac{b}{2})^2 = (a + \frac{a}{2})^2 + (0 + \frac{b}{2})^2 ... (1)$ 
 $\implies \frac{a^2}{4} + b^2 + \frac{b^2}{4} + b^2 = a^2 + \frac{a^2}{4} + a^2 + \frac{b^2}{4}$ 
 $\implies b^2 = a^2$ 
 $\implies b = a$ (since distance can never be negative) 
 Putting $b=a$ in $1$, we get $0=0.$ Similarly, we can prove for $C$. Now, is this approach correct or do I need to individually calculate the distances and then show that they are equal?

 Some definitions that I am using: 
 $k$ -surface :
Let  $k,N\in\mathbb{N}$ ,  $k<N$ ,  $M\subset \mathbb{R}^N$  is called a  $k$ -surface , if there exists a non-empty open set  $E\subset \mathbb{R}^k$  and a map  $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{R}^N$ , such that: (i)  $\varphi(E)=M$ , (ii)  $\varphi\in C^1(E;\mathbb{R}^N)$ , and (iii) the rank of Jacobi matrix of  $\varphi$  is equal  $k$  everywhere on  $E$ .
The surface is called  simple  if  $\varphi$  is also injective on  $E$  and  $\varphi^{-1}$  is continuous of  $\varphi(E)$ . 
 Surface integral of the first kind :
Let  $k,N\in\mathbb{N}$ ,  $k<N$ ,  $M\subset \mathbb{R}^N$  is a simple  $k$ -surface parametrized by the map  $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{R}^N$ , from the open set  $E\subset \mathbb{R}^k$  and  $f:\mathbb{R}^N\to\mathbb{R}$  is defined on  $M$ .  The surface integral of the first kind  is defined by:
 $$
\int_M f\,\mathrm{d}S:=\int_E f(\varphi(t))\sqrt{\det{G(D_\varphi(t))}}\,\mathrm{d}t\,,
$$ 
if the integral on the right exists in the Lebesgue sense and is finite. Here,  $G(A)$  denotes the Gramm matrix made from columns of  $A$  and  $D_\varphi$  is the Jacobi matrix of the map  $\varphi$ . The numeric value of:
 $$
S_k(M):=\int_M f\,\mathrm{d}S\,,
$$ 
is called the  $k$ -dimensional surface area of the  $k$ -surface  $M$ . 
 Motivation for the question 
 Now these definitions can be used to calculate e.g. the surface of a unit sphere. When one describes the sphere by the map (omitting one longitudinal line):  $\varphi: (\eta,\psi)\mapsto(\cos\psi\cos\eta,\cos\psi\sin\eta,\sin\psi)$ , where  $(\eta,\psi)\in E=(0,2\pi)\times(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$ . The Gramm matrix looks like:
 $$
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos^2\psi & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$ 
 one ends up with the (here  $\lambda_2$  denotes the Lebesgue measure):
 $$
S_2(M) = \int_E 1\sqrt{\det{G(D_\varphi(\eta,\psi))}}\,\mathrm{d}\lambda_2(\eta,\psi)=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\cos\psi\,\mathrm{d}\psi\,\mathrm{d}{\eta}=4\pi
$$ 
 I did not do anything else but blindly followed the definitions. 
 The wrong result: 
 If I do the same approach to the above problem at hand. My map is  $\varphi:\,(\theta,\phi)\mapsto (r(\theta,\phi),\theta,\phi)$ , the Jacobian is then:
 $$
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial r(\theta,\phi)}{\partial \theta} & \frac{\partial r(\theta,\phi)}{\partial \phi} \\
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$ 
 The rank of this matrix is 2 as needed for a 2-surface. The Gramm matrix is then:
 $$G(D_\varphi)=
\begin{pmatrix}
1+ \left(\frac{\partial r(\theta,\phi)}{\partial \theta}\right)^2 & \frac{\partial r(\theta,\phi)}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial r(\theta,\phi)}{\partial \phi} \\
\frac{\partial r(\theta,\phi)}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial r(\theta,\phi)}{\partial \phi} & 1+ \left(\frac{\partial r(\theta,\phi)}{\partial \phi}\right)^2 
\end{pmatrix}
$$ 
with determinant evaluated to:
 $$
\det(G(D_\varphi)) = 1 + \left(\frac{\partial r(\theta,\phi)}{\partial \theta}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial r(\theta,\phi)}{\partial \phi}\right)^2
$$ 
 which leads to the surface area: 
 $$S=\int_{S\subset\mathcal{R}^3}{\rm d}S=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\partial r}{\partial \theta}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial r}{\partial \varphi}\right)^2}\;{\rm d}\theta\,{\rm d}\varphi$$ 
 Which is incorrect. The question is why, and please show the correct way with explanation because as suggested by the example with unit sphere, I did not have to do any transformations and it did work with curvilinear coordinates right away. So the answer provided by Quanto does not address this at all. 
 Note to the edit: 
 I have added quite a lot of details since the answer by Quanto, but the root problem is the same - to see by calculation explicitly how one arrives to the correct result and to understand why the my calculation for a sphere works (where i am not using Cartesian coordinates) but fails here.

\frac{2}{3}\\1\\\end{bmatrix}$$  so that the desired line has the equation  $y=a+bx=\frac{2}{3} +x$ . The components of the vector  $\overline{\mathbf{x}}$  can also be interpreted as the coefficients of the columns of  $A$  in the linear combination of the columns of  $A$  that produces the projection of  $\mathbf{b}$  onto the column space of  $A$  [which the Best Approximation Theorem identifies as the best approximation to  $\mathbf{b}$  in the subspace  $\mathrm{col}(A)$ ]. In other words, the projection of  $\mathbf{b}$  onto  $\mathrm{col}(A)$  can be found from the coefficients of  $\overline{\mathbf{x}}$  by  $$\mathrm{proj}_{\mathrm{col}(A)}(\mathbf{b})=\frac{2}{3}\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\\\end{bmatrix}+1\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\3\\\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{5}{3}\\\frac{8}{3}\\\frac{11}{3}\\\end{bmatrix}$$  But when I try to calculate  $\mathrm{proj}_{\mathrm{col}(A)}(\mathbf{b})$  directly [taking  $\mathbf{a}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{a}_{2}$  to be the first and second columns of  $A$ , respectively], I get  $$\mathrm{proj}_{\mathrm{col}(A)}(\mathbf{b})=\left(\frac{\mathbf{a}_{1}\cdot\mathbf{b}}{\mathbf{a}_{1}\cdot\mathbf{a}_{1}}\right)\mathbf{a}_{1}+\left(\frac{\mathbf{a}_{2}\cdot\mathbf{b}}{\mathbf{a}_{2}\cdot\mathbf{a}_{2}}\right)\mathbf{a}_{2}=\left(\frac{\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\\\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}2\\2\\4\\\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\\\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\\\end{bmatrix}}\right)\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\\\end{bmatrix}+\left(\frac{\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\3\\\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}2\\2\\4\\\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\3\\\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\3\\\end{bmatrix}}\right)\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\3\\\end{bmatrix}$$   $$=\frac{8}{3}\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\\\end{bmatrix}+\frac{18}{14}\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\3\\\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{8}{3}\\\frac{8}{3}\\\frac{8}{3}\\\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}\frac{9}{7}\\\frac{18}{7}\\\frac{27}{7}\\\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{83}{21}\\\frac{110}{21}\\\frac{137}{21}\\\end{bmatrix}$$  I am quite confident that my calculation is incorrect, for a number of reasons. For example, when I take the component of  $\mathbf{b}$  orthogonal to  $\mathrm{col}(A)$   $$\mathrm{perp}_{\mathrm{col}(A)}(\mathbf{b})=\mathbf{b}-\mathrm{proj}_{\mathrm{col}(A)}(\mathbf{b})=\begin{bmatrix}2\\2\\4\\\end{bmatrix}-\begin{bmatrix}\frac{83}{21}\\\frac{110}{21}\\\frac{137}{21}\\\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{41}{21}\\-\frac{68}{21}\\-\frac{53}{21}\\\end{bmatrix}$$  I get a vector that is not perpendicular to either  $\mathbf{a}_{1}$  or  $\mathbf{a}_{2}$ , indicating that this vector is not in the orthogonal complement of  $\mathrm{col}(A)$ .

 Unfortunately, I used a different and rather clumsy way to approach this question. 
 My attempt was not successful but I was wondering if there is anyone who can tell me how to go further with it and arrive at the solution. 
 
 My attempt:
I drew it out like birth and death process with 11 states. With  $-1$  and  $9$  having the probability of returning to itself as 1 (absorbing state).
Let's  $P(X_i)$  be probability to reach  $-1$  before reaching  $9$ , starting from  $i$ . 
 Then I listed out  $$P(X_0) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}P(X_1)$$ 
 $$P(X_i) = \frac{1}{2}\left(P(X_{i-1}) + P(X_{i+1})\right) \ \ \text{ for } i \in\{1,2,3,...7\}$$ 
 $$P(X_8) = \frac{1}{2}P(X_7) + 0$$

"I'm aware for Fourier Cosine Series you have an even extension of f(x) and the Sine Series has an odd extension, the former requiring  a_o ,  a_n , and cosine as the periodic function, with the latter containing  b_n  with sine as the periodic function.  However, can't any function be translated to either its sine or cosine series equivalent?  Why bother learning both methods?  Is there some inherent difference that I'm not recognizing?  If anything, shouldn't you always just calculate the sine series for every f(x) since you only have to compute one coefficient ( b_n )?

"This is for self-study of $N$-dimensional system of linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations of the form:
$$
\mathbf{\dot{x}}=A\mathbf{x}
$$ 
 where $A$ is the coefficient matrix of the system. 
 I have learned that you can check for stability by determining if the real parts of all the eigenvalues of $A$ are negative. You can check for oscillations if there are any purely imaginary eigenvalues of $A$. 
 The author in the book I'm reading then introduces the Routh-Hurwitz criterion for detecting stability and oscillations of the system. This seems to be a more efficient computational short-cut than calculating eigenvalues. 
 What are the advantages of using Routh-Hurwitz criteria for stability and oscillations, if you already have the eigenvalues? For instance, will it be useful when I start to study nonlinear dynamics? Is there some additional application that I am completely missing, that I would miss out on by focusing on eigenvalues? 
 Wikipedia entry on RH stability analysis has stuff about control systems, and ends up with a lot of material in the s-domain (Laplace transforms), but for my applications I will be staying in the time-domain for the most part, and just focusing fairly narrowly on stability and oscillations in linear (or linearized) systems. 
 I am asking b/c it seems easy to calculate eigenvalues on my computer, and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion comes off as the sort of thing that might save me a lot of time if I were doing this by hand, but not very helpful for doing analysis of small-fry systems via Matlab where I have the eig(A) function.

"The following problem is taken from a Swedish 12th grade ‘Student Exam’ from 1934. 
 
 $\mathit{ABCD}$  is a rectangle with the sides  $\mathit{AB}=15$  cm and  $\mathit{BC}=12$  cm. On  $\mathit{AB}$ , between  $A$  and  $B$ , is a point  $E$  placed such that  $\mathit{AE}=2$  cm. There are two rectangles, inscribed in the given rectangle, which has a corner at  $E$  and corners on each of the three other sides of the given rectangle. Calculate the area of the two rectangles. 
 
 Below I present two solutions which have the correct answer in two different ‘formats’. The latter is the one given as answer in a book. The first solution, that gives the more ‘convoluted’ format, also includes an equation that is, perhaps, not as easy to solve unless one observes a particular (imaginary) solution first. Also, the calculations are pretty cumbersome to do by hand, as they were in 1934, so I lean towards thinking there is a simpler way to arrive at the answer, in its simplest form. I look forward to hear your thoughts on how to solve this problem. 
 As basis for both solutions we use the following figure; 
 
 where  $l_1$  and  $l_2$  are straight lines representing the longer sides and  $n_1$  and  $n_2$  the perpendicular lines (called ‘normal’ in Swedish) representing the shorter sides. 
 
 Solution 
 Method 1 
 Let  $l_1$  and  $l_2$  have the slope  $k$ . 
 We have the following equations for the straight lines;
 \begin{align*}
\text{\(l_1\):} & \quad y=k(x-2)\\
\text{\(n_1\):} & \quad y=-\tfrac{1}{k}(x-2)=-\tfrac{1}{k}x+\tfrac{2}{k}\\
\text{\(l_2\):} & \quad y=kx+\tfrac{2}{k}
\end{align*} 
 The  $y$ -coordinate of  $F$  is
 $$ y_F=k(x-2)\big|_{x=15}=13k $$ 
and the  $x$ -coordinate of  $G$  is given by the equation
 $$kx_G+\frac{2}{k}=12 \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad x_G=\frac{12-2/k}{k}.$$ 
 The slope for  $n_2$  is given by
 $$ \frac{y_F-y_G}{x_F-x_G}=\frac{13k-12}{15-\tfrac{12-2/k}{k}}.$$ 
 Since  $n_1$  is parallell to  $n_2$  we get
 $$
\frac{13k-12}{15-\tfrac{12-2/k}{k}}=-\frac{1}{k}
\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
13k^4-12k^3+15k^2-12k+2=0.
$$ 
 This equation is not that easy to solve explicitly at ’first sight’, but we observe that  $k=\pm i$  solves the equation and thus we can, after polynomial division, write
 $$13k^4-12k^3+15k^2-12k+2=(13k^2-12k+2)(k^2+1)$$ 
and we find the remaining solutions to be
 $$k=\tfrac{1}{13}(6\pm\sqrt{10}\,).$$ 
 For the two  $k$  we get the following figure; 
 
 The dimensions of the two rectangles are given by the ‘distance formula’ and we get
 \begin{align*}
|\mathit{EF}|^2&
=(2-15)^2+(0-13k)^2\big|_{k=\frac{1}{13}(6-\sqrt{10}\,)}=215-12\sqrt{10}\\
|\mathit{EH}|^2&
=(2-0)^2+(0-\tfrac{2}{k})^2\big|_{k=\frac{1}{13}(6-\sqrt{10}\,)}=50+12\sqrt{10}\\
|\mathit{EF'}|^2&
=(2-15)^2+(0-13k)^2\big|_{k=\frac{1}{13}(6+\sqrt{10}\,)}=215+12\sqrt{10}\\
|\mathit{EH'}|^2&
=(2-0)^2+(0-\tfrac{2}{k})^2\big|_{k=\frac{1}{13}(6+\sqrt{10}\,)}=50-12\sqrt{10}
\end{align*} 
 The areas can now be calculated to be (in  $\text{cm}^2$ )
 \begin{align*}
A_1&=|\mathit{EF}|\cdot|\mathit{EH}|=\sqrt{9310+1980\sqrt{10}}\\
A_2&=|\mathit{E'F'}|\cdot|\mathit{E'H'}|=\sqrt{9310-1980\sqrt{10}}
\end{align*} 
 This is the more ‘convoluted’ answer. It can be simplified further, but that is not obvious(?) at ‘first sight’. The simpler format is given as result in Method 2 presented below. 
 Method 2 
 We proceed as above but we calculate the areas of the 4 triangles;
 \begin{align*}
A_1&=\frac{1}{2}\cdot(15-2)\cdot y_F=\frac{169}{2}k\\
A_2&=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2}{k}\cdot2=\frac{2}{k}\\
A_3&=\frac{1}{2}\cdot x_G\cdot(12-y_H)=\frac{2(1-6k)^2}{k^3}\\
A_4&=\frac{1}{2}\cdot(12-13k)\cdot\Bigl(15-\frac{12-2/k}{k}\Bigr)=\frac{(12-13k)(15k^2-12k+2)}{2k^2}
\end{align*} 
and add up the total triangle area to be
 $$ A=A_1+A_2+A_3+A_4=168-13k-\frac{11}{k}-\frac{12}{k^2}+\frac{2}{k^3}, $$ 
hence the area of the rectangle is
 $$ R=12\cdot15-A=12+13k+\frac{11}{k}+\frac{12}{k^2}-\frac{2}{k^3}.$$ 
 For the values  $k=\frac{1}{13}(6\pm\sqrt{10}\,)$  we get
 $$ R=90\pm11\sqrt{10}~\text{cm}^2. $$ 
 This is the answer given in the book.

"We have two crates, crate 1 and crate 2. Crate 1 has 2 oranges and 4 apples, and crate 2 has 1 orange and 1 apple. We take 1 fruit from crate 1 and put it in crate 2, and then we take a fruit from crate 2. 
 The first point of this exercise asks me to calculate the probability that the fruit taken from crate 2 is an orange. I did this by calculating the probability that the fruit we took from crate 1 was an orange(which is $\frac{2}{6}$) and then saying that I have 3 fruits in crate 2, $1+\frac{2}{6}$ oranges and the rest apples, which lead me to a $44.44\%$ probability that the fruit we take from crate 2 was an orange. The probability I got seems reasonable, but I don't know for sure if what I did was correct. 
 Anyway, point 2 of this problem is a little bit harder and I'm stuck. It tells me to calculate the probability that the fruit we took from crate 1 was an orange, if we know that the fruit we took out from crate 2 was also an orange.
So if I consider A: Fruit taken from crate 1 was an orange, and B: Fruit taken from crate 2 was an orange, I think I have to calculate $\:P\left(A|B\right)$ I think, which means ""Probability that A happens if we know B happened"", but I'm not so sure about this.

 $$\ln(y)=\ln(x)x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}}$$ 
 $$\ln(y)=y\ln(x)$$ 
 after taking derivative with respect to x on both sides, I obtained the following: 
 $$\frac{\mathrm dy}{\mathrm dx}=\frac{y^2}{x(1-\ln(y))}$$ 
 I am fairly certain that the calculations up to this point are valid. However, to further continue, I analyzed the nature of y in different domains and obtained the values, by observation(that is, by observing how $x$, $x^x$, $x^{x^x}$, $x^{x^{x^x}}$, and so on would behave to draw a conclusion): 
 
 for $x<1,$ $y$ becomes 0 
 for $x=1,$ $y$ becomes 1 
 for $x>1,$ $y$ becomes infinite

"My question is about: if I am given simple prior probabilities, how do I calculate ""complex"" (events formed from the simple events in the simple prior probabilities) posterior probabilities? I am aware of Bayes' Rule, where I can go between the posterior and prior probabilities. 
 A specific question: Suppose there are three aircraft. We want to travel from our current location to a remote location, and back again. Let us call the remote location $d$ and the local location $l$. Thus, there are two ""moves"" (transits). The event $D$ means the aircraft arrives late to the remote location and the event $L$ means the aircraft arrives late to the local location. The probability of choosing aircraft $i$ is given. 
 $$ P(A_1) = 0.5, P(A_2) = 0.3, P(A_3) = 0.2 $$ 
 We are given the probability of being late to the remote location if we are on an aircraft $i$. We are also given the probability of being late to the local location if we are riding on an aircraft $i$. 
 $$ P(D|A_1) = 0.3, P(L|A_1) = 0.1 $$
$$ P(D|A_2) = 0.25, P(L|A_2) = 0.2 $$
$$ P(D|A_3) = 0.4, P(L|A_3) = 0.25 $$ 
 Then, how do I calculate the probability that I am on airline 1, given the observation that I am late on one and exactly one transit?  
 Note that this is not a simple event, it is the event $(D \cap L') \cup (D' \cap L)$, where $'$ means event negation. This is causing me difficulties in using Bayes' rule. If it were asking for probabilities involving simple events like $P(A_1 | D)$ or $P(A_1 | D')$, I could immediately use Bayes' rule. 
 My understanding is the probability we are looking for is $P(A_1 | (D \cap L') \cup (D' \cap L))$. I have already tried doing $ P(A_1 | D') \times P(A_1 | L) + P(A_1 | D) \times P(A_1 | L') $. This does not seem to match the expression $P(A_1 | (D \cap L') \cup (D' \cap L))$.  
 Also, the chance of a late arrival at L is unaffected by a late arrival at D. This question comes before the section on independence.  
 Also, there was a hint to use a tree diagram and label the branches in terms of number of late arrivals (0,1,2). I have tried this but I got stuck. Specifically, my first branch is: (late remote branch up, p = 0.305), (not late remote branch down, p = 0.695). These probabilities were calculated by enumerating all possible (late, airline) combinations and adding the appropriate probabilities. 
 Then, out of the first two branches, I can branch further by doing (aircraft $i$ given late remote, p = determined through Bayes' since they are simple events), (aircraft $i$ given not late remote, p = determined through Bayes' since they are simple events). At this stage, I have six branches with 2 levels, and I am unsure of how to continue. Also, the hint in the book seemed to imply we only needed 2 levels. 
 Any help would be appreciated, specifically on how to solve this type of problem. 
 Thanks.

"The question is : An apple crumble is taken out of the oven at 7:30pm.

 $\frac{dT}{dt} = k (T-100)$ 
 $T = Ae^{kt}+ 100$

 $80 = Ae^{10k} + 100$

 $65 = -20/e^{10k}*e^{20k} + 100$

 $1.75 = e^{20k}/e^{10k}$ 
 $1.75 = e^{10k}$ 
 $(\ln(1.75))/10 = k$  
 Therefore subbing it back into $A , A = -80/7$ 
 $T = -80/7e^((ln(1.75))/10t) + 100$

"When I was still in elementry school (4-12 years old in Holland) we were tought to do multiplication without the use of a calculator, for example  128 * 415 . When I came home with some homework my father recalled a trick he learned when he was younger. I remembered this recently, but can't figure out how it works. 
 First you calculate the result: 
     128
    415 x
  -------
    640
   1280
  51200 +
 --------
  53120
 
 Then the trick: Take the separate digits of the first number:  1,2 and 8 . Add these together:  1 + 2 + 8 = 11  While the result is more than one digit, do it again:  1 + 1 = 2 . The first ""checksum"" is 2. 
 Do the same for the second number:  4 + 1 + 5 = 10 , then our second checksum is 1:  1 + 0 = 1 . 
 Multiply these checksums:  1 * 2 = 2.  The  checksum of the input  in this case is 2. 
 Now we do the same for the answer we calculated:  5 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 11 , This means our  answer checksum  is 2:  1 + 1 = 2 . 
 Finally compare both ""checksums"": we found 2 for the input and 2 for the answer, which means our answer might be correct. I'm pretty sure it's not a 100% secure check with chances of false-positives, but I haven't come across one where the checksum failed on a correct answer, or where the checksum was correct but the answer was invalid. 
 The question: Can anyone explain how this works?

"I'm making plots for Chia, a cryptocurrency which isn't ""mined"" in the strict sense of the word, but instead requires that one have many files known as ""plots"" on a storage drive (e.g. a hard disk drive). Units of cryptocurrency are primarily awarded based on total space consumed: more free space on a drive means a smaller chance of scoring a win. 
 The smallest size of plot, known as the ""k=32"" plot, takes up  $101.4$  gibibytes (GiB) of storage. While I can fill a hard drive with that many plots, it doesn't maximize the space on the drive. As an example, if I have a hard drive with  $3725.29$  GiB of space (4 terabytes), I can make a maximum of  $36$  k=32 plots on it, and still have  $74.89$  GiB of space remaining on it. 
 To help minimize the amount of free space on a drive, I can make larger plot sizes as per the below table: 
 
 
 
 
 Plot type 
 Space required (GiB) 
 
 
 
 
 k=32 
 $101.4$ 
 
 
 k=33 
 $208.8$ 
 
 
 k=34 
 $429.8$ 
 
 
 k=35 
 $884.1$ 
 
 
 
 
 However, even though each successive plot size takes about  $2.06$  times as much space as the last, the process of generating a successively larger plot size uses significantly more than that much computing time and energy (exact amount not known). As such, while the most optimal solution to maximize used space is to make as many larger plots as possible, I instead want to make as many small plots as possible, which in turn leads to having as many overall plots as possible. 
 Given a size of a storage drive in GiB, how can I calculate the best combination of plots to store on the drive, when I want to both get as many overall plots on the drive as I can and end up with as little free space as possible? 
 Also, what are the best combinations when attempting to meet these concrete goals on hard drive sizes of  $3725.29$  GiB and  $5587.94$  GiB? 
 It seems like I'd need to optimize the inequality  $101.4a + 208.8b + 429.8c + 884.1d \leq capacity$  for both the maximum value of  $a+b+c+d$  and the closest value of  $\frac{101.4a + 208.8b + 429.8c + 884.1d}{capacity}$  to  $1$ . But how can I optimize for both?

"I'm working with the following problem: 
 We have a triangle with sides  $AB=3$  and  $BC=2$ , the angle  $ABC$  is 60 degrees. Find the dot product  $AC \cdotp AB$ 
 Since we don't actually know the side  $AC$  my first step is to calculate this side via the law of cosines. 
 $$AC^2=AB^2 +BC^2 -2AB\cdot BC\cos x$$ 
 $$\implies AC^2=3^2 +2^2 -2\cdot2\cdot3\cos 60^\circ$$ 
 $$\implies AC^2=9 +4 -12\cdot0.5$$ 
 $$\implies AC^2=13-6=7$$ 
 $$\implies AC=\sqrt 7.$$ 
 My next step is to calculate the angle  $BAC$ ; we should be able to use the law of cosines here as well: 
 $$BC^2=AB^2+AC^2-2\cdot AB\cdot AC\cos x$$ 
 $$\implies4=9+(\sqrt 7)^2 -2\cdot3\sqrt 7\cos x$$ 
 $$\implies4=9+7 -6\sqrt 7\cos x$$ 
 $$\implies-2=-6\sqrt 7\cos x$$ 
 $$\implies\frac{1}{3}=\sqrt 7\cos x$$ 
 $$\implies\frac{1}{3\sqrt 7}=\cos x.$$ 
 If we want to calculate our dot product using only the vector lengths, we would use the fact that  $A\cdotp B=|A||B|\cos x$ , which in this case would mean that: 
 $$AB \cdot AC=3\sqrt7\frac{1}{3\sqrt 7}=1,$$ 
 which is quite wrong since the answer is supposed to be  $12$ . 
 Can someone please tell me where I've made a mistake? 
 In the proposed solution another method seem to be used. The textbook claims that  $AB \cdotp AC = AB \cdotp (AB + BC)=AB \cdotp AB + AB \cdotp BC = |AB|^2 + |AB||BC|cos(60)=9+6*\frac{1}{2}=12$

 Given $L_1=\begin{cases}P_1: x-y+z=4\\ P_2: 2x+y-z=6 \end{cases}$  
 and $L_2=\begin{cases}P_1:x+y+z=4\\ P_2:2x+3y-z=6 \end{cases}$ 
 $L_1$ and $L_2$ are the intersection lines of the given planes. Find the angle between the lines $L_1,L_2$ 
 
 First in order to find the intersection lines between the respective planes it is enough to find to dots that belong to the intersection line, so for $L_1$:
$$
P_1+P_2 \Rightarrow 3x=10 \Rightarrow x={10 \over 3}
$$ 
 Then: 
$$
2 \cdot \frac{10}{3}+y-z=6 \Rightarrow y-z=-\frac{2}{3}
$$
For $z=0$ and $z=1$ we get $y=-\frac{2}{3}$ and $y=\frac{1}{3}$ respectively so now can represent $L_1$ parametrically: $(\frac{10}{3},\frac{1}{3}, 10)+t(0,-1,0)$ where $t(0,-1,0)$ is the direction vector.  
 After identical calculations we can find $L_2: (0,\frac{10}{4}, \frac{3}{2})+t(\frac{10}{3}, 0,-\frac{2}{3})$. 
 Now we can calculate the angle of $L_1, L_2$ via scalar product:
$$
\cos \theta=\frac{L_1 \cdot L_2}{\Vert{L_1}\Vert \cdot \Vert L_2 \Vert}=0 \Rightarrow \theta=90^{\circ}

   $$ E: \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1,$$ 
  where  $a,b>0$ , and the point  $p(t)=(at,bt),$  where  $t\in(0,+\infty).$  Let  $q(t)\in E$  be the point that minimizes the distance between  $p(t)$  and  $E$ . Calculate:
   $$ \lim_{t \to +\infty}q(t).$$ 
 
 So, my way to think of a solution was using Lagrange multipliers in the following steps: let  $f(x,y)=\|(x,y)-p(t)\|^{2}$  and  $g(x,y)=\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}};$  now I should find  $x,y,\lambda$  such that  $\nabla f(x,y) =\lambda\nabla g(x,y)$  and  $g(x,y)=1.$ 
 It's not that hard to write  $x$  and  $y$  depending on  $\lambda,$  but as soon I plug the values of  $x$  and  $y$  at the last equation to find  $\lambda$  and then get the correct  $(x,y)$  minimizing point, I end up with a huge polynomial of  $\lambda$  that I hardly believe I should solve. 
 Is that the correct step-by-step? Is there any other clever way of doing it? 
 Thanks on advance for the help!!!

"What I need are the power-series for sinh and cosh that are faster to calculate.
For example, here is the standard sin(x) power series:
 $$\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^9}{9!} - \cdots  $$  
And now the modified power series:
 $$\sin(x)=x\left(1-\frac{x^2}{3 \cdot 2}\left(1-\frac{x^2}{5 \cdot 4}\left(1-\frac{x^2}{7 \cdot 6}\left(\phantom{\frac{}{}}\cdots\right.\right.\right.\right.$$

 $$\cos x =1-\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}-\frac{x^6}{6!}\cdots $$ 
And now the modified power series:
 $$\cos x =1-\frac{x^2}{2\cdot 1}\left(1-\frac{x^2}{4 \cdot 3}\left(1-\frac{x^2}{6 \cdot 5}\left(1-\frac{x^2}{8 \cdot 7}\left(\phantom{\frac{}{}}\cdots\right.\right.\right.\right.$$   
 The modified power series are much faster to calculate because the denominators are much smaller numbers than the Factorials, after (or about) 15! or the 7th iteration. There is a huge difference in time spent calculating  $$\frac{x^7}{7!} $$  and calculating  $$ 1-\frac{x^2}{7 \cdot 6}$$

 [Answering the 1st reply And Yes, there must be a better way to answer, but I don't know that method.]
I knew this question was close at hand. I can only give ""short answers"". I am a computer programmer. I am using a different kind of number system that uses an Integer-array to contain a number, rather than just using one (1) 16 bit to a 64 bit memory place. I do add, subtract, multiply, and divide an array with an integer (array/integer) or another array (array/array). But dividing an array with another array is very slow. I want to divide using only an integer which is much faster. So, I know this sounds very odd but this is the basic ""short"" reason or answer.     
 [Answering the 2nd reply]
No, no floating, or doubles, or decimals. These types of numbers and the algorithms used to make the calculations, have a degree of inaccuracy. Using only integers, power-series and continued-fractions, then any degree of accuracy or precision can be achieved. Yes this does sound odd, but it is my little project.     
 [Answering the 3rd reply]
I rather not use GNU C library. I believe they use polynomials and tables. Which is fine for 6 to 12 decimals of accuracy. But I rather not. Thank you very much.

If you can see, there is something special about the question itself.
At  $x=2$  the  $f(x)=0/0$ . But when we calculate derivative of  $g(x)$  we get,
 $h(x)= (x^2-4x+4)(x-4)^{-1}$  but  $h(x)$  is not equals to  $0/0$  at  $x=2$ ...

To get specific first off, it's about this graph:
 
 
 I want to get from $A$ to $B$. Every edge has the same length (e. g. 1 m). The shortest walk from $A$ to $B$ is easily found ($A-2-5-B$ and $A-3-6-B$). But how can I calculate the average length of a walk and its probability, when I am navigating randomly through this graph (what is the length/probability of $n$ steps)? At every node, there is a chance of $p= \frac{1}{degree}$ to choose any next edge (also back, where I just came from).
For example, there would be a chance of walking in circles for a long time, but probability decreases - also to get straight through. 
 I wrote a computer simulation to find a statistic answer: After a megaattempt (1000000 attempts), it averaged at about 20.329 edges for this specific graph here.

  Solve for $x$ using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. 
 
 I was taught that the remainder theorem says that given$$\begin{align*} & x\equiv b_1\mod n_2\tag4\\ & x\equiv b_2\mod n_2\tag5\\ & \cdots\cdots\cdots\cdots\cdots\cdot\tag6\\ & x\equiv b_r\mod n_r\tag7\end{align*}$$
Then $x\equiv b_1c_1\dfrac {N}{n_1}+b_2 c_2\dfrac {N}{n_2}+\cdots+b_rc_r\dfrac {N}{n_r}\mod N$ where $N=\prod\limits_{n=1}^r n_r$ and $c_i\dfrac N{n_i}\equiv 1\mod n_i$. 
 
 Using this, we have $(b_1,b_2,b_3)=(3,2,5)$ and $(c_1,c_2,c_3)=(1,2,1)$. Hence, $x\equiv 120\equiv 0\mod 30$. Which is obviously wrong.

"Two integers [not necessarily distinct] are chosen from the set {1,2,3,...,n}. What is the probability that their sum is <=k? 
 My approach is as follows. Let a and b be two integers. First we calculate the probability of the sum of a+b being equal to x [1<=x<=n]. WLOG let a be chosen first. For b= x-a to be positive, we must have 1<=a < x. This gives (x-1) possible values for a out of total n possible values. Probability of valid selection of a= (x-1)/n. For each valid selection of a, we have one and only one possible value of b. Only 1 value of b is then valid out of total n possible values. Thus probability of valid selection of b= 1/n. Thus probability of (a+b= x) = (x-1)/n(n-1). 
 Now probability of (a+b<=k)
= Probability of (a+b= 2) + probability of (a+b= 3) + ... + probability of (a+b= k) 
= {1+2+3+4+5+...+(k-1)}n(n-1)
= k(k-1)/n(n-1). 
 Can anybody please check if my approach is correct here?

 I have done the following:  
 The intereset rate is $q=1+\frac{p}{100}=1+\frac{4,5}{100}=1+0,045=1,045$.  
 Since we are paying every month for $10$ years, we are paying for $12\cdot 10=120$ months.  
 Using the formula \begin{equation*}\overline{R_m}=\frac{r\cdot q_m\cdot \left (q_m^m-1\right )}{q_m-1}\end{equation*}  
 with $m=120$, $r=200$ und $q_m=\sqrt[12]{q}=\sqrt[12]{1,045}=1.003675$,

The function is given by 
 
 $$\sigma(z)_j=\frac{e^{z_j}}{\sum_{k=1}^Ke^{z_k}},\quad \text{for }j=1,...,K$$

"Let $M\in \Bbb{R}^n$ be an open set, and let $\rho: M \to \Bbb{R}$ be continuous. Then define $v: M\to \Bbb{R}^n$ as
$$v(x) = \int_{r\in M} \frac{\rho(r)(x-r)}{\|x-r\|^n} \, dr$$
Where the above integral is taken component-wise. (if $n = 3$, we can imagine $\rho$ as charge density, and $v$ as the resulting electric field). I now wish to find the divergence of $v$, so first I calculate the $i^\text{th}$ partial derivative of the $i^\text{th}$ component. 
$$\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \int_{r\in M} \frac{\rho(r)(x_i-r_i)}{\|x-r\|^n} \, dr$$
Since the region of integration does not depend of $x_i$, if I'm not mistaken, we can move the derivative to the inside of the integral and differentiate using the quotient rule:
$$ = \int_{r\in M}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\frac{\rho(r)(x_i-r_i)}{\|x-r\|^n} \, dr = \int_{r\in M}\frac{\rho(r)\|x-r\|^n - n\rho(r)(x_i-r_i)^2\|x-r\|^{n-2}}{\|x-r\|^{2n}} \, dr$$
(since $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\|x\|=\frac{x_i}{\|x\|}$)
$$ = \int_{r\in M}\frac{\rho(r)\|x-r\|^2 - n\rho(r)(x_i-r_i)^2}{\|x-r\|^{n+2}} \, dr$$
So we have
$$\nabla \cdot v= \int_{r\in M}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\rho(r)\|x-r\|^2 - n\rho(r)(x_i-r_i)^2}{\|x-r\|^{n+2}} \, dr$$
$$= \int_{r\in M} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(\rho(r\|x-r\|^2) - n\rho(r) \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-r_i)^2}{\|x-r\|^{n+2}} \, dr$$
$$ = \int_{r\in M}\frac{n\rho(r)\|x-r\|^2 - n\rho(r)\|x-r\|^2}{\|x-r\|^{n+2}} \, dr = 0$$
But this seems false since it contradicts Gauss's law--we expect to get $\nabla \cdot v(x) = \lambda_{n-1}\rho(x)$ where $\lambda_{n-1}$ is the surface area of a unit $(n-1)$-sphere.  
 As a specific example, let $n = 1, M = (-1,1), \rho(x) = x$, and so
$$v(x) = \int_{-1}^1\frac{r\cdot (x-r)}{|x-r|} \, dr = \int_{-1}^x r \, dr + \int_{x}^1 -r \, dr = x^2 - 1$$ and so $\nabla \cdot v = 2x$, which is not identically zero. Where have I gone wrong? I feel like I must be misunderstanding the conditions under which one can exchange the order of differentiation and integration, but  this  (first equation under the ""higher dimensions"" section) seems to be exactly what I'm doing (since the second term on the right hand side disappears since the area of integration does not depend on $x_i$).

"Imagine a 2-dimensional right triangle drawn on graph paper (a lattice), with the right corner originating at (0,0).  Each unit on graph paper has a width of 1 unit.  The lengths of the base and height for this triangle can be any real number.  Is there a formula for determining the number of lattice points contained in the triangle?  By lattice point, I mean where the lines cross on the graph paper, which is where coordinates are integer values. The image (#1) below shows a triangle with area of 2 square units, containing 6 lattice points. 
 
 And another similar image (#2), this time with triangle area being 7 square units, and containing 13 lattice points: 
 
 QUESTION:  Is there a formula to calculate the number of lattice for arbitrary values of base and height? 
 As a background, I am doing this as a hobby as I try to figure out a computer programming challenge.  I have studied up through calculus-1 and calculus-2 in college, but that was many years ago.  If more details are desired, let me know.   
 I realize that this could be solved algorithmically with loops in a computer program.  But the real challenge involves the volume of an N-dimensional hyperpyramid, with very large dimensional values, and a requirement to be calculated in < 1 second.  So I am hoping for an actual formula.   
 EDIT: (changed ""vertex points"" to ""lattice points"" above, after encountering better terminology).  
 UPDATE: Studying link from Somos led me to Pick's theorem ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem ): 
 A = i + b/2 - 1
or
Area = Number_of_internal_lattice_points + Number_of_boundry_lattice_points/2 - 1
 
 I can calculate total area ""A"" from the formula for a triangle, using a Floor() function for the dimensions to align with lattice points, required for Pick's theorem.  I am looking for (i+b), so I need to next determine b.  That would be: 
   Floor(base_length)+1    +

  Floor(height_length)+1  +

  number_of_lattice_points_on_hypotenuse_not_including_end_points
 
 So how to calculate the number of integer lattice points would fall on the hypotenuse?   
 The image (#3) below has a slope (m) = rise / run = -1/4. 
 
 But image #2, from above, has a slope of -2/7 and NO lattice points on the hypotenuse. 
 
 But if we were to scale this triangle by factor of 2, we would have a slope of -4/14 and 1 lattice point on the hypotenuse.   
 So I think the general steps will be: 
 
 Find slope (m) by Floor(height) / Floor(base) 
 Find largest integer number N that can reduce slope while still keeping numerator and denominator integers. 
 This number N is the number of divided segments of the hypotenuse.  The number of lattice points is N-1

 Show that the sequence  $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$  in  $l^2$  given by
   $$
(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} := \left(1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},...,\frac{1}{n},0,0,0,...\right)
$$ 
  converges to
   $$x=\left(1, \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},...,\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n+1},...\right)$$ 
  in  $l^2$ . 
 
 Firstly I'm having a problem to understand the first definition. It defines a class of sequences of  $l^2$  in the RHS, not just one sequence as stated in the LHS. And to say that this sequence converges to a sequence in  $l^2$  it must be the case that it's actually a sequence  $((x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$  of sequences of  $l^2$ . Seems alright? 
 That being right, I still don't know how to calculate the limit. Given  $\varepsilon > 0$ , I must find an  $N$  such that  $n>N$  implies that the sequence  $(1,\frac{1}{2},...,\frac{1}{n},0,0,0...)$  is  $\varepsilon$ -distant to  $(1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},...,\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n+1},...)$ . But  $$\|(1,\frac{1}{2},...,\frac{1}{n},0,0,0...)-(1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},...,\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n+1},...)\| = \|(0,0,0...,\frac{1}{n+1},\frac{1}{n+2},...)\| = $$ 
 $$

"I was trying to understand why it was mathematically justified to multiply edge probabilities in a tree diagra and I came across the following question: 
 Why do we multiply in tree diagrams? 
 The second answer is nearly exactly what I needed, however, there are some things that I still don't understand about it. Or maybe there are just some things about the answer that are not mathematically rigorous enough for me (or trivial enough for the poster that the details were omitted), specially in the context of view probability with  set theory . That is what I wish to address: how to treat probability tree diagrams with set theory rigorously and thus calculate probabilities on trees in a mathematically justified way. 
 The main issue that I have is how leaves/outcomes are specified with set notation in a sloppy way, which leads has lead to weird justification of calculating probabilities in tree diagrams. I will try to address what I think the issue are in detail in the frame of set theory to make sure that everything is precisely and clearly defined. 
 The exact issue that I am having is with the notation $\cup$ and $\cap$ being used to describe probabilistic statements. In high school we are taught to think about these as AND and ORs. I wish to abandon that mentality (since I think its one of the reasons for my confusion) and be extremely precise on the use of $\cap$ and $\cup$. Intersection and Union are two operations that only apply to  sets . I will use them in that way and wish to address their correct use in probability theory. 
 First lets try to define ""outcome"" and ""events"" precisely and see how they relate to tree diagrams. 
 An  outcome  normally means a specific way of specifying the result of an experiment. For example, in the monty hall problem we can specify the outcome of the experiment by the following triplet: 
 
 outcome = (car location, player's initial guess, door revealed by the host). 
 
 i.e. an outcome is fully specified when we specify the location where the car actually is, what the players initial guess is and the door that was revealed by the host. Hence resulting in the following tree diagram: 
 
 ( which I got from MIT's course for mathematics for computer science 6.042 ).
as it can be appreciated, the leaves of the tree are the outcomes and all the leaves are the whole samples space $S$. In these terms the samples space is the set of triples: 
 
 Now, an  event  is a subset of this samples space, i.e. choosing a subset of the leaves. 
 The issue that I have is that I have seen the leaves of such a tree trees diagram denoted as $(A \cap A \cap B)$ (for the first one on my example) instead of $(A, A, B)$. For me, these two are not the same. The second triplet is just a  sequence  that acts as an ""index"" to specify a specific outcome in the sample space (which is an element of the set $S$). The notation with intersection (i.e. $A \cap A \cap B$) tries to specify a leaf but it seems plain wrong to me and confusing (or horrible abuse of notation? not sure...). Let me justify why I think its an incorrect way to specify a leaf: 
 
 firstly, it is not clear to me what $(A \cap A \cap B)$ even means. For me, that just means the empty set, because intersection should only be applied to sets and $(A \cap A \cap B)$ has no intersection.  
 secondly, even if you try to ""repair"" the first issue by insisting that the first position, second and third position are simply events and taking intersections of them is valid, still brings problems. i.e. $(A \cap A \cap B)$ are intersection of ""events"" is still wrong I believe. That solution only bring further problems/question. First, if A is now an event, then, what exactly is it a subset of? (since thats what an event is. If you are trying to use set notation to denote stuff, you better specify what the sets/subsets are). How do we re-define the sample space so that this notation indication of a leaf is justified? If we could do this, then (maybe) the justification explained in the question I posted might be valid (with further justifications).  
 If you try to use set notation to specify a leaf, it seems to me that the correct way to do it is by unions, not intersections. The reason is because, that would actually lead to the correct meaning of what a triplet specifies (and avoid having the issue of the empty set that I specified in my first point). However, since the order of the elements of a sets ""don't matter"" and because the triplets are  sequences  (where the order maters), the way to fix the new problem I have introduced by using unions is by using a subscript on the position of the triplet (kind of defining a bijection) i.e. the outcome $(A, A, B)$ corresponds $\{ A_1 \cup A_2 \cup B_3\}$. Anyway, taking this definition doesn't help that much, because its not clear to me how to use the general chain rule of probability to justify the probability of a leaf. 
 
 Basically, how do you rigorously justify using the chain rule of probability to calculate the probability of a single outcome in a probability tree diagram?

 Now I have decomposed the curve into two linear curves and then written the integral over  $\gamma_z$  as the integral over these two curves. I obtained the following curves:
 $$\gamma_{z1}(t)=(1+iy)t+(1-t)=1+tiy$$  and  $$\gamma_{z2}(t)=(x+iy)t+(1-t)(1+iy)=t(x-1)+1+iy$$  for  $t\in [0,1]$ . Then I calculated the following integrals  $$\int_{\gamma_{z1}}\frac{1}{w}dw=\left(\frac{1}{iy}+1\right) \log(1+iy)$$  and  $$\int_{\gamma_{z2}} \frac{1}{w}dw=\log(x+iy)-\log(1+iy)$$  It follows  $$\int_{\gamma_z}\frac{1}{w}dw=\frac{1}{iy}\log(1+iy)+\log(x+iy)$$ . 
 But is this even true up to this point? Now I thought I'd just derive these complex functions and I'd be done but I'm not quite sure if I'm allowed to do it this way.

"The ""extended"" Goldbach conjecture defines R(n) as the number of representations of an even number n as the sum of two primes, but the approach is not related directly with ${\pi(n)}$, is there any kind of Goldbach-${\pi(n)}$ (I will call it G${\pi(n)}$ for short) function?  
 http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoldbachConjecture.html 
 I have tried an approach to that idea as follows. 
 
 Calculate ${\pi(n)}$ 
 Calculate ${\pi(n/2)}$ 
 I defined then G${\pi(n/2)}$ as the subset of primes p from ${\pi(n/2)}$ that are symmetrical on n/2, so they have a counterpart prime pc = n-p in [n/2,n-2] so n=p+pc. 
 I did a test for the first 2000 even numbers (my computer slows down very much after that point) and prepared a graph showing ${\pi(n)}$, ${\pi(n/2)}$, G${\pi(n/2)}$ and the linear interpolation of the value of G${\pi(n/2)}$ (a kind of average value of the growing G${\pi}$ set of primes. 
 Then I played with lower values of the ${\pi}$ function looking for a lower bound of the linear interpolation. Finally ${\pi(n/10)}$ seemed a good value to define a lower bound for G${\pi(n/2)}$ because the linear interpolation is always over that value (at least in the test it seems so). 
 
 Here is the graph. 
 
 When I checked the results, I wondered if there is a way to work on the conjecture through a relationship between Goldbach's comet value for n, and ${\pi(n)}$, specially if the density of the subset of primes in [2,n/2] that are symmetrical in n/2 is always greater than the density of primes in a lower subset of ${\pi}$ function (e.g. ${\pi(n/10)}$). 
 So the question is: is there any relationship already known or being researched with ${\pi(n)}$ or only the extended Goldbach conjecture R(n) function is the correct approach to a solution of the Goldbach conjecture?

"Given word MISSISSIPPI I am asked to count the number of (1) permutations where all P's are side-by-side (2) permutations where P's are side-by-side and I's are side-by-side. For the first question, I did $$\frac{9!}{4! 4!} \times 10$$ since I have two sets of 4 indistinguishable letters, and I multiply by 10 because 2 P's can be placed in 10 different places in between/to the sides of the remaining letters. The (2) confounds me though. I did start with $$\frac{5!}{4!}$$ and proceeded to multiply by the number of ways I's and P's could vary within the word. So, fixing PP in the beginning, I got 6 variations for IIII, and vice-versa.

"I'm having trouble solving this relation:  $a_n = a_{n-1} + 2^{n-1} - 1$  as a part of my university assignment. 
 My intention was to start with finding the  $a_{n}^{h}$ , and for that I've tried finding a characteristic equation for the homogeneous part of equation ( $0 = a_{n} - a_{n-1}$ ). Solving  $0 = x - 1$  left me with a single root  $r_1 = 1$ , and hence the  $a_{n}^{h} = \alpha(1^n)$ . 
 Then I tried to find the  $a_{n}^{p}$ , and for that I was advised to solve independently for  $a_{n} - a_{n-1} = -1$  and  $a_{n} - a_{n-1} = 2^{n-1}$ , and to add the acquired results to obtain  $a_{n}^{p}$ . 
 So I tried to start by solving  $2^{n-1} = a_{n} - a_{n-1}$ . I thought that first expressing  $2^{n-1}$  as  $\frac{1}{2}(2^n)$ , will allow me to use  $\frac{A}{2}(2^n)$  for my guessed form, and so substituted it into the equation obtaining:  $\frac{A}{2}(2^n) = \frac{A}{2}(2^n) - \frac{A}{2}(2^{n-1})$ , and then I tried to simplify it by first expressing the second term in the difference as  $\frac{A}{4}(2^n)$ , and then dividing the equation by  $2^n$ , and sequentially multiplying by 2 which left me with  $A = A - \frac{A}{2}$ , which made zero the only valid solution. 
 Then I tried to solve  $-1 = a_n - a_{n-1}$ . Since -1 is a constant I replaced it with  $A$ , and solved the following equation  $A = A - A$  (here I was very confused, but it was the only way constant substitution made sense to me), so this also leaves zero as the only possible value. 
 Then combining  $a_{n}^{h}$  and  $a_{n}^{p}$  yielded  $a_n = \alpha(1^n) + 0$ , leaving me with just  $a_n = \alpha(1^n)$ , and at this point given the initial conditions  $a_0 = a_1 = 0$ , I've decided to solve for alpha and to no surprise also got zero. 
 At this point I saw that solution was horribly wrong, and absolutely had no clue where because to be honest none of it is perfectly clear to me, but to verify that its certainly wrong I made a rust script to calculate first 10 terms of the sequence which definitely weren't zeroes.  Here it is , just in case. 
 Any help would be appreciated but I would be grateful even more if you could point flaws in my process (I know that there are quite a few, so hopefully there are patient people), rather then providing some from the blank solution.

"I'm trying to understand a  Montgomery reduction algorithm , for which I need to calculate a  multiplicative inverse .
However,  Euclidean algorithm  only helps if  $A < B$ . 
 Example is  $11 \mod 3$ .
 Multiplicative inverse  of  $11$  is  $2$ ,but  ext_gcd  gives you  Bezout  numbers such as -1 and 4. 
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm 
 Wikipedia says so: 
 
 The  extended Euclidean algorithm  is particularly useful when  $a$  and  $b$  are  coprime , since  $x$  is the modular  multiplicative inverse  of  $a$  modulo  $b$ , and  $y$  is the modular  multiplicative inverse  of  $b$  modulo  $a$ . 
 
 But as far as I see, this can't be true, either  $X$  is  multiplicative inverse  of  $A$  modulo  $B$   or   $Y$  is  multiplicative inverse  of  $B$  modulo  $A$ , but not both at the same time, because one of them ( $A$  or  $B$ ) is going to be bigger than another. We have  $X=4, Y=-1$  for  $A=3,B=11$ , and  $X=4$  is valid inverse, while  $-1$  is indeed not. 
 A lot of online calculators that I tried are also said that a has to be bigger than be, but they (some of them) are still able to calculate inverse of  $11 \mod 3$ . 
 The only workaround I found so far is perform  $A = A \mod B$  first, so  $A$  is now a remainder of divisions and therefore is less than modulus, so we can perform  ext_gcd(2, 3)  now and get our  $2$  as answer. 
 Probably I'm missing something, this thing is pretty new for me.

"I'm trying to understand the constraints resulting from differentiating an unit normal field $N$ on a surface $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.  If I write the unit-length constraint at a point $p \in S$,
I have: 
$$\langle N(p), N(p) \rangle = 1$$ 
 Here, the angle brackets correspond to the standard dot product in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
(For notational simplicity, I'll leave out the $p$ from now on.)  I can take a directional derivative of this equation in the direction $\vec{v} \in T_p S$ to get: 
 $$ \langle D_\vec{v} N, N \rangle + \langle N, D_{\vec{v}} N \rangle = 0  $$ 
 This shows that the image of the differential of the Gauss Map lies in $T_p (S)$. 
 I can continue along this analysis, taking more and more directional derivatives to get constraints on the higher derivatives, e.g if $\vec{u} \in T_p (S)$ 
 $$ \langle D_{\vec{u}} (D_\vec{v} N), N \rangle + \langle  D_\vec{v} N, D_\vec{u} N \rangle + \langle  D_\vec{u} N, D_\vec{v} N \rangle + \langle N, D_{\vec{u}}(D_{\vec{v}} N)\rangle = 0 $$ 
 I would like to think of this process in tensorial terms -- that is, terms like $D_{\vec{u}} (D_\vec{v} N)$ can be considered as a $(1, 2)$ tensor.  So, let me write $D_{\vec{u}} (D_\vec{v} N)$ as $D^2 N$ and so on.
For example, if I take $m$ derivatives, I will get terms such as T = $\langle D^i N, D^j N \rangle$ where $i + j = m$. I believe I can think of $T$ as a $(0, m)$ tensor, where I place the first $i$ inputs into the $D^i N$ and the next $j$ inputs into the $D^j N$.  To be more precise, I think I need to consider $D^i N$ as a (1, i) tensor and $D^j N$ as a (1, j) tensor and then the dot product forms some kind of contraction.   
 My question involves how to represent these terms via arrays and computation. How do I represent a single term like $T$ as a m-dimensional array that can take in $m$ vectors?  For now, I would just like to verify (via code and a given surface, so I can calculate derivatives of the normal field of any order) that if I sum up the L.H.S of each equation, I will get 0.  But how do I express these tensors correctly? I do not want to choose my directions (like $\vec{v}, \vec{u}$) explicitly, but instead write the tensor formulations as arrays of numbers in a tangent plane basis.  So, when I sum up all the terms, I should get a m-dimensional array of zeros. 
 I think I need to be careful, as there is an ordering of inputs that notation like $D^i N$ hides.   That is, there will be multiple terms involved of the same order derivatives, but involving different input vectors.  For example, if my first three inputs are $\{\vec{v}, \vec{u}, \vec{w}\}$, I don't think I can consider the tensor $\langle D_\vec{u} (D_\vec{v} N), D_\vec{w} N \rangle$ as equal to the tensor $\langle D_\vec{w} (D_\vec{v} N), D_\vec{u} N \rangle$.  Thus, I believe I will need to rearrange dimensions of these arrays in a proper fashion.  But I don't know what ""proper"" is. 
 I apologize if this writeup is unclear; please ask for clarification if needed.  And thank you so much for any enlightenment you can give me!  Even a suitable reference would be much appreciated! 
 EDIT:  
 To be more precise about my confusion:  Suppose I take $n$ derivatives.  I will have terms like $D^i N$, with $i < n$.  Although an individual $D^i N$ is a $2 \times 2 \cdots \times 2 \times 3$ array, with $i + 1$ total dimensions, I need to ""embed"" it as a $n + 1$ dimensional array in order to dot product it or sum it with the various other terms in the equation.  This is because the different $D^i N$ terms are tensors acting on different sets of input vectors.  So, to combine these different tensors, I need to place them all in the same space -- the space of $(1, n)$ tensors. 
 If I know my normal field and surface completely, this should just be a matter of bookkeeping.  I believe I just pad certain dimensions (corresponding to the unused inputs) of the arrays with copies of the rows from the dimensions of the used inputs.  In this fashion, these tensors will be independent of the set of $n - i$ unused inputs. Is this correct?

 Quickly after running this program for about an hour I realized running this kind of calculation on any computer today would absolutely take ages, I was hopping to reach 0,001 % on the calculation but it is certainly too large to calculate, but then the question came up, exactly how long would it take? That question is not so easy to answer considering there is alot of factors involved, but really what I am trying to solve is the factorial of  1,e+80 . 
 $$(1\times10^{80})!$$ 
 The number can be very hard to understand just how big it is, so I'd like to visualise how big that number is, for instance, if you could calculate how long it would take for a computer to calculate the factorial of  1,e+80  that would be a cool visualization. 
 ( EDIT:  Thanks for the great answers, however, I wish to implement a way of calculating the factorial of  1,e+80  in a application despite I would need to use some kind of approximation formula, so I decided to use Stirling's approximation based on  derpy 's answer.
$$n! \sim \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n$$
So with Stirling's approximation and  GMP library  for C programming language it would be possible to make a quite accurate and efficient program to calculate the factorial of  1,e+80

"How would I go about taking a percentage of 24 hours and converting it into an hour? 
 Basically, this is for a piece of code that I'm writing - and I need to calculate figures for every hour in the year. 
 So far, the total of hours in the year is 8760 (365 * 24). What I need to work out from this is what hour this would represent in a day. 
 For example, 8760 would be 24 (it's the 24th hour on the 365th day). 25 would be 1 (the first hour on the second day). 57 would be 4 (the 4th hour on the 3rd day). 
 I can work out the percentage of 24 hours by doing the following: 
 1 / 24 = 0.041666666666667
0.041666666666667 * 100
 
 If I times the number after the decimal point by 100 - it gives me the percentage of 24 hours (I think!). I'm pretty much stuck at what to do with this number. 
 I hope I'm missing something obvious but what mathematical formula could I use to figure these numbers out reliably? 
 I hope I explained that well enough! Thanks!

"I need to calculate, or at least to find a good estimate, for the following sum
 $$ \sum_{n_1+n_2 + \dots + n_k = N}\frac{1}{(n_1+1)(n_2+1)\dots (n_k+1)},\quad (1)$$ 
where  $n_i \ge 1$ . These numbers represent volumes of particular hyperpyramids in a hypercube, therefore the title of the question. 
 Update:  The motivation section below contains an arithmetic error, but the required sum seems to appear nonetheless in an updated formula, and I also guess that this kind of sum may appear quite naturally in all sorts of tasks. 
 Motivation: 
I have independent equidistributed  $\mathbb{R}$ -valued random variables  $\xi_1,\dots,\xi_{N+1}$  with  $P(\xi_i = \xi_j) = 0$ . Denote by  $\Diamond_i$  either  $<$  or  $>$ . Then, provided  $\sharp\{\Diamond_i \text{ is} >\} = k$  the probability of the event
 $$P\left(\xi_1\Diamond_1\xi_2, \xi_3\Diamond_2\max(\xi_1,\xi_2),\dots, \xi_{N+1}\Diamond_N\max(\xi_1,\dots,\xi_{N})\right) = \frac{1}{(n_1+1)(n_2+1)\dots (n_k+1)}, \quad(2)$$ 
where  $n_1 + \dots + n_k = N$  and  $n_i \ge 1$  and correspond to the places where  $\Diamond_i$  is a  $>$ . By design, all events of the form  $\sharp\{\Diamond_i \text{ is} >\} = k$  are mutually exclusive, so  $P(\sharp\{\Diamond_i \text{ is} >\} = k)$  is the sum of all possible events of the from  $(2)$ , which gives  $(1)$ . 
 Extended task : What I am actually about to calculate is  $P(\sharp\{\Diamond_i \text{ is} >\} \le k)$ , which thus gives a formula
 $$\sum_{l=1}^k \sum_{n_1+n_2 + \dots + n_l = N}\frac{1}{(n_1+1)(n_2+1)\dots (n_l+1)}.\quad (3)$$  This formula, though more complex, may have some nice cancellations in it, perhaps.

 A friend of mine has a Lipschitz function $f\colon [0,1]\to\mathbb R$ satisfying
  (Some more characters, and yet a few more...)
  $$|f(a)-f(b)| \le 5 |a-b| \qquad\text{for all }a,b\in[0,1],$$
  and s/he would like to estimate the integral $\int_0^1 f$ to within $0.00001$; i.e., to find a number $E$ such that
  $$\left| E-\int_0^1 f\right| \le 0.0001.$$ 
 Even though the formula for the function is very complicated (and will not be divulged here), my friend can and will calculate the value of the function at any input to within $0.000006$. My friends is also willing and able to program a calculator to carry out  basic arithmetic instructions  as instructed, but s/he does not know Calculus at all. 
 
 Argue that $f$ is indeed Riemann integrable. 
 Provide a  list of detailed instructions  for simple arithmetic calculations that can be carried out by my friend (described above), so that the result of these calculations is guaranteed to be within $0.0001$ of $\int_0^1 f$ 
 Supply a proof showing that the calculation on your list will indeed yield an answer that is within $0.0001$ of $\int_0^1 f$. 
 
 
 Part 1 seems easy, all I need to do is to show that Lipschitz implies continuous and bounded which implies Riemann integrable. It's the other stuff which are more challenging. 
 Part 2/3: The instructions I am thinking of are attempting to divide the interval [0,1] into n subintervals and calculating the area under these intervals, (using the average of the function at the beginning of each interval as an evaluation point to take into account the error in computing the function), and then the error will/should decrease as n increases.  
 I am not sure I am going in the right direction, and if so, not sure how to formally represent this. Can someone show me a detailed proof for how to do this?

 $$y+1 = 2r\sin(\phi)$$ 
 $$|J| = 6r$$ 
 Substituting this in the first inequality we get that  $r^2 \le 1$ , which means  $r \in [0,1]$  for now. 
 Now here's the problem. In the second inequality we have: 
 $$r\sin(\phi) \ge 0$$ 
 As  $r$  is already greater or equal to zero, we have that  $\sin(\phi) \ge 0$ , and thus that  $\phi \in [0, \pi]$ 
 One can also see this by drawing a picture, the line  $y=0$  is the x axis and we get that it's greater than zero above the x axis, which is from  $0$  to  $\pi$ 
 Substituting this, I get the following double integral: 
 $$ \int_{0}^{\pi}\int_{0}^{1} 6rdrd\phi$$  and when I solve it I get that the solution is  $3\pi$ . However, my workbook states that the solution is  $2\pi - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$

 My answer to the first: 
The random variable $Z=(Y|X=3)$ distribution is: 
 $\mathbb{P}_Z(z=0)=\mathbb{P}_Z(\left\{TTT\right\})=\frac{1}{8}$ 
$\mathbb{P}_Z(z=1)=\mathbb{P}_Z(\left\{HTT,THT,TTH\right\})=\frac{3}{8}$

 So finding $E(Z)$ is easy. 
But I have no idea how to find $E(Y)$, beacuse I am not really sure how the joint distribution table looks like for $X$ and $Y$ - it's dimensions depends on the $X=x$ value.  meaning, for every $x\in X$, $Y$ gets different possible values!

"I'm testing out a few different kind of metrics for a reranking application. I was curious and wanted to try running the PageRank algorithm to see if it could help at all. I used a similarity metric to generate ""links"" between items in the list that needed reranking.  
 The PageRank works by simulating a random web surfer. We create a matrix that represents the links between pages and then calculate the probability of surfing to another page. This is done by iterative multiplication of the NxN transition matrix by the 1xN matrix representing the probability of moving to each of the pages. I followed the simple implementation outlined  here . 
 My first problem was that I had a symmetric similarity metric; a completely symmetrical link matrix resulted in equal ranks for every single page. I tried using a less symmetrical metric and produced the following matrix: 
   7 -26 -32 
-14   8 -14 
-20 -14   8 
 
 The transition matrix then was: 
 -0.09 0.49 0.60
 0.66 -0.33 0.66 
 0.73 0.52 -0.24 
 
 And after running the algorithm all three pages were ranked 0.39, which is useless.
My question is how to tell if a matrix will end up producing equal PageRanks. If I knew the characteristics of the required matrix, I could search for suitable metric to fill the matrix and then experiment properly with the algorithm.

 I know there are 6^5 = 7776 different throws. 
 For the poker there are 6 different values possible (111111,222222,333333 etc)
so the probability is 6/7776 
 For the four of a kind theres 6*5*5 = 150 
150/7776 
 But at the three of a kind is where I get stuck (and the other hands), wikipedia tells me there is an probability of 1200/7776. I don't know how they got the 1200.

 I know that series like the $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_n}{n2^n}}$ are evaluated  here , but the evaluations end up with some values of the $\zeta$ function, like $\zeta (2),\zeta(3).$ 
 First approach : Using the generating function of the harmonic numbers and integrating term by term, I concluded that 
 $$\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_n}{n2^n}=\int_{0}^{\frac{1}{2}}\frac{\ln (1-x)}{x(x-1)}dx},$$ 
 but I can't evaluate this integral with any real-analytic way.  
 First question:  Do you have any hints or ideas to evaluate it with real-analytic methods? 
 Second approach : I used the fact that $\displaystyle{\frac{H_n}{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k(n+k)}}$ and then, I changed the order of summation to obtain 
 $$\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_n}{n2^n}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{2^k}{k}\left(\sum_{m=2k}^{\infty}\frac{1}{m2^m}\right)}.$$

 My intuition would be that it is basically a set of four ""scans"" of the 400 numbers, so the probability of hitting the 1/3000 searched number in each of the scans is roughly 400/3000 = 2/15. This would give the total probability count as (2/15)x(2/15)x(2/15)x(2/15) = 16/50625 = 0,000316. However, I'm not sure if this accounts (and if it should account) for the fact that it is a fixed sample so it's not ""re-rolled"" for each of the four scans.

(1.) $\lim_{x\to a} f + g = L1 + L2$

"Let $\Omega = D(0,2)/\{\frac{1}{2}\}$ , where $D(0,2)$ is a disc, $f$ holomorphic in $\Omega$. 
 $\frac{1}{2}$ is a simple pole for $f$ with residue $1$, calculate $$ lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f^{n}(0)}{2^{n}n!}$$ 
 Observations : if $f(z) = \sum_{n}a_{n}z^{n}$ in $D(0,\frac{1}{2})$ then $a_{n}=\frac{f^{n}(0)}{n!}$ so $ lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f^{n}(0)}{2^{n}n!} =  lim_{n \to \infty} a_{n}(\frac{1}{2})^{n}$ . But $\frac{1}{2}$ is a pole so the series is not convergent. How can we proceed?

"Four people around a room. What is the probability that two (or more) of them have the same birthday?   
 However, I am not sure if my working out assume finds out about the 2 or more part. I am using the pigeon hole method the most suitable approach for answering this question 
 Here is my working out 
 $P(A)$ = 2 or more people having the same birthday 
 This is difficult to find. However, I can use the Pigeon Hole theory.  
 $P(A')$ = 2 people having the same birthday 
 Thus $P(A) = 1 - P(A')$ 
 To calculate P(A') 
 $P(A') = (1/365)^4 * (365*364*363*362) $  
 $P(A') = 0.9836440875$ 
 $P(A) = 1 - P(A')$ 
 $P(A) = 1 - 0.9836440875$ 
 $P(A) = 0.0163559125$ 
 Thus it approx 1.635% that 2 or more people will have the same birthdays.

"Consider the following optimal stopping game:  The controller is presented with steps in a fair random walk (fair coin flips, $P(h)=P(t) = \frac{1}{2}$) and at each stage of the game, the controller can stop and take a payoff of $\frac{H}{H+T}$ where $H$ is the number of heads encountered up till that point, and $T$ is the number of tails. 
 A proposed stopping strategy is to stop the first time the payoff exceeds $\frac{1}{2}$. Note that this strategy does eventually stop, with probability 1. (This is probably in fact the optimal strategy, but that is not the point of this question.) What is the expectation value of the payoff if that strategy is used? 
 I have been able to calculate the probability $g_m$ of stopping at step $2m+1$ as
$$
g_m = \frac{1}{2^{2m+1}}\frac{1}{m+1} \binom{2m}{m}
$$
and the contribution to the expected payoff is from the possibility of stopping at step $2m+1$ is
$$
e_m = \frac{1}{2} g_m \left( 1+\frac{1}{2m+1} \right)
$$ 
 It is then easy to show that $e_0 = \frac{1}{2}$ and for all integer $n>0$ 
$$
e_n=\frac{(2n-1)^2}{2n(2n+1)}e_{n-1}
$$ 
 To find the expected payoff I need to find
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty e_n

 Thus the question: 
If $e_0 = \frac{1}{2} $and $\forall n\in\Bbb{N}:e_n=\frac{(2n-1)^2}{2n(2n+1)}e_{n-1}$, find $\sum_{n\geq 0} e_n$

 Now, consider the triple $48, 55, 73$. 
 Then, $\sqrt x = \sqrt{48^2}$ since the side has to be $48$ units.  
 $\sqrt{2304} = 48$. 
 Therefore, $x = 2304$.

"I'm looking for a geometric construction which would allow me to draw an ellipse, which is supposed to be an orthographic projection of a great circle of a sphere, given two points on it. 
The following picture shows what I need: 
 
 I have some circle drawn, which is a projection of that sphere. 
Then, I have two points drawn (red), which are projections of two points on that sphere. 
Now I need to find a way to draw an ellipse (blue), which is a projection of the great circle passing through these two points. That is, I need to find the orientation of its axes, and the ratio of major to minor axis, geometrically. 
 What I know is that the major axis is the same as the diameter of the circle & sphere. Those two points are coplanar: their radii (red lines) lie on the same plane, and in the picture these are projections of the radius of the sphere & circle. 
 I can find constructively the minor axis of the ellipse representing a great circle with arbitrary tilt to the view plane, knowing the point which is the end point of its axis on the sphere (its pole). What I'm missing is how to find that pole's position on my drawing from these two red points I know, through some geometric construction using these two points. 
 Edit 1:  Here's my construction I use to get from the pole's position to the ellipse:
   
 First, I draw a perpendicular to my axis (the axis is green). Next, I draw a circle (blue) to find the same distance as my axis on the perpendicular. Then I project this point perpendicularly to meet the circle, and again perpendicularly to meet my axis. This point designates the minor radius of my ellipse, so I can draw it.
The second picture (on the right) explains why does this work: I can view my ellipse from the side, as some diagonal line (blue-green) laying at some angle to the level. I can find the sine of this angle by just projecting the point, where the blue-green line meets the circle, straight down (orange). The cosine is then the red line, and coversine is blue. Since the axis (green) is always perpendicular to the blue-green plane of the great circle, It is at the same angle to the vertical direction, and has the same sine, cosine and coversine, but rotated 90 degrees. So when I know the distance of the pole from the center on my drawing, I can reverse this process to find these sines and cosines and then the minor radius of my ellipse I'm looking for. 
 So my problem reduces now to finding the location of this pole point from my known red points. 
 Any ideas how to find it? 
 To be clear, I know how to do it analytically, through vector cross products, matrices etc., and how to calculate it, but that's not what I'm looking for. I need to do it just by geometrical constructions. And I suppose it is possible, since all those cartographers in the past somehow managed to draw all those maps, and astronomers all those sky domes, right? ;-J 
 Edit 2: 
OK, I have some idea. Not much pretty, but it works :->
I can use my two red radii as axes for two other great circles -- this is what I can do already: draw an ellipse being a projection of a great circle for a given axis of that circle, so why not to exploit it here too? ;-)
Then, I will get two such great circles crossing each other at two points, since they lie on two planes intersecting each other in a line. And this line has to be perpendicular to both red radii! :-> That's the green line I'm looking for.
Having the green radius, I would be able then to draw the blue ellipse I'm looking for, on which both these points lie. 
 
 Now I need to find out some simplification of this procedure, which wouldn't require me drawing two additional ellipses, since it's quite expensive construction. I only need their two points of intersection.

 Solution 1:  There is no identical object in the probability. By circular permutation, number of elements of sample space is $(6-1)!=5!=120 $. Number of  elements of the given event is $(3-1)!\cdot 2\cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 16$ Hence, probability of given event $$ p= \dfrac{16}{120} = \dfrac{2}{15} $$ 
 Alternatively Solution 2:  There is no identical object and there is no identical location in the probability. That is, we can't use circular permutation and identical objects. So, number of  elements of sample space is $6!=720$. Number of the given event is $3!\cdot 2\cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 48$.  Probability of given event $$ p= \dfrac{48}{720} = \dfrac{1}{15} $$ 
 Alternatively Solution 3:  We have to take identical object same color balls. Easily, we can calculate number of elements of sample space that $16$. Also, Number of  elements of the given event is $2$. Therefore, probability of given event $$ p= \dfrac{2}{16} = \dfrac{1}{8} $$

Now, since (1) implies $\xi_n^2=1+n \xi_n$, it is safe to say that $a_n$ can be ultimately expressed as a linear function of $\xi_n$. 
 In other words, if we expand $a_n$ in terms of $\xi_n$, all of the $\xi^m,m>1$ terms can be eliminated and replaced with lower degrees. And if we repeat this process, we would finally have:

D_x\Phi(t,x)=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial\Phi_1(t,x)}{\partial x_1} & \ldots & \frac{\partial\Phi_1(t,x)}{\partial x_n}\\\vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\\frac{\partial\Phi_n(t,x)}{\partial x_1} & \ldots & \frac{\partial\Phi_n(t,x)}{\partial x_n} \end{pmatrix}
$$
so I have to determine
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\text{det}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial\Phi_1(t,x)}{\partial x_1} & \ldots & \frac{\partial\Phi_1(t,x)}{\partial x_n}\\\vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\\frac{\partial\Phi_n(t,x)}{\partial x_1} & \ldots & \frac{\partial\Phi_n(t,x)}{\partial x_n} \end{pmatrix}
$$
This is the same as determining
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\text{det}(\text{grad}\Phi_1(t,x),\ldots,\text{grad}\Phi_n(t,x)).
$$
To my knowledge now it is
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\text{det}(\text{grad}\Phi_1(t,x),\ldots,\text{grad}\Phi_n(t,x))=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{det}(\text{grad}\Phi_1(t,x),\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\text{grad}\Phi_j(t,x),\ldots,\text{grad}\Phi_n(t,x)).
$$
So, I think that with $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\text{grad}\Phi_j(t,x)$ it is meant
$$
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{\partial\Phi_j(t,x)}{\partial x_1},\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{\partial\Phi_j(t,x)}{\partial x_n}\right)^T
$$
and because of Schwartz I think it is
$$
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{\partial\Phi_j(t,x)}{\partial x_1},\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{\partial\Phi_j(t,x)}{\partial x_n}\right)^T=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\Phi_j(t,x)}{\partial t},\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\frac{\partial\Phi_j(t,x)}{\partial t}\right)^T\\
=\text{grad}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_j(t,x).
$$
So what is searched for to my opinion is
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{det}(\text{grad}\Phi_1(t,x),\ldots,\text{grad}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_j(t,x),\ldots,\text{grad}\Phi_n(t,x))
$$ 
 (2) 
 It is $\text{grad}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_j(t,x)=\text{grad}f_j(x)$.
The j-th summand is given by
$$
\text{det}(e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_{j-1},\text{grad}f_j(x),e_{j+1},\ldots,e_n)
$$
with $e_i=(0,\ldots,0,1,0,\ldots,0)^T$ with the 1 on i-th position.  
 This determinant can be calculated by making a triangle matrix out of it. So this determinant is $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}f_j(x)$. 
 So it is
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}D_x\Phi(t,x)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}f_j(x)=\text{div}f.
$$ 
 So that are my results for  (1)  and  (2) . 
 I would really like to know if I am right.
Would be great! Ciao!

 The above is a Python  list  of three sub-lists, each  list  describes an arc, the first element is a  tuple , it is a coordinate of the arc's center, the second element is the radius of the arc, the third and fourth elements are the starting and ending degrees of the arc. 
 The centers of the arcs are vertices of an equilateral triangle, all arcs have the same radius and span 60 degrees. 
 (The center of the Reauleaux triangles are all at the origin) 
 Basically, I want to remove the extra blank spaces in pictures like this by limiting the axes: 
 
 To do that, I need to calculate the bounding box of any given Reuleaux triangle, but I don't know how to do that, and again, Google searching proved futile. 
 I only know a very specific case, if the Reuleaux triangle is directly upwards (I don't know how to describe it in any natural language), like this: 
 
 Then the left-most point is the left vertex, the right-most point is the right vertex, the top is the other vertex, and the lowest point is on the lowest arc halfway between the vertices, and the bounding box is a square. 
 I know how to calculate the bounding box in this specific case, but I won't show the calculations here, for fear of over-cluttering the post. 
 So how to calculate the bounding box of any Reuleaux triangle given the parameters above? 
 
 I am trying to find the four coordinates of the square that is tangent to the Reuleaux triangle. 
 For example, if the lowest side is parallel to the x axis, and the equilateral triangle has radius  $r$ , then the three coordinates of the vertices are: 
 $\begin{aligned}
(0&, r) \\
(- \frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, - \frac{r} {2}) \\
(\frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, - \frac{r} {2})
\end{aligned}$ 
 And the lowest point is: 
 $(0, r - \sqrt{3} r)$ 
 Then the coordinates of the vertices of the bounding square is (counter-clockwise): 
 $\begin{aligned}
(- \frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, r - \sqrt{3} r) \\
(\frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, r - \sqrt{3} r) \\
(\frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, r) \\
(- \frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, r)
\end{aligned}$ 
 I already worked all these out before I have written the post, and that's how I made the second picture. 
 I am asking, given the coordinates of the three vertices of a  ROTATED  Reuleaux triangle, how to calculate the four coordinates of the vertices of the bounding square of the triangle? 
 
 The accepted method indeed does work.

in polar coordinates, $x\mapsto \rho \cos\theta$ and $y\mapsto \rho \sin\theta$, to get

so I was induced to think that the limit should be $0$, since, for any $\theta$ I choose (even those that make $\cos\theta$ vanish, since they make the whole thing vanish), the rational expression should have limit $0$ as $\rho \to 0$. But then one could choose the path along the parabolic arc $P = \{(x,y)\ |\ x=y^2,\ y>0 \}$ and consider the restriction of $g$ to $P$:
$$(g|_P)(x,y) = g(y^2,y) = \frac 1 2 \quad \forall (x,y)\in P $$
which would mean the limit along the restriction is $\neq 0$ and the overall limit shouldn't exist.

 I want to completely ignore momentum, air resistance, etc. 
 I have found it trivial to calculate the resulting trajectory using ""brute"" methods when the path is reflected at a perfect horizontal or vertical angle, and it may even be trivial to reflect at 45 degree angles, such as coming into contact with a flat wall, or horizontal surface, or perfectly 45 degree surface.
The problem I have is I need (for coding) a way to handle contact with a surface at any 360 degree angle. 
 I don't want to calculate any loss of momentum from the impact of the collision at the x,y point. 
 I'm not sure what the proper term is for what I'm asking for, I describe what I'm trying to do as ""reflecting"" or ""mirroring"" a trajectory about a given angle at a given point. 
 EDIT:
I've drawn a graphic to illustrate what I'm trying to say
 
 The top black trajectory represents a projectile's trajectory undisturbed fired from x-3,y0. 
 The bottom blue trajectory represents the same projectiles trajectory if it was disturbed by a 90 degree (straight up/down, or vertical) line, which the trajectory reflects off of based on the angle of the line at the point of contact (that point is x0,y2.5.)  
 The gravity is the same, towards the horizontal plane, or the ""ground"", before and after reflection, it's not changed in any way, merely the trajectory changes direction.  
 This is trivial to solve for a 90 degree line, or 180 degree line, or maybe 45 degree lines, but a formula or equation which plots x and y of the trajectory after the x0,y2.5 point, no matter what angle the line is at there at x0,y2.5, is what I'm after.

 Blackjack is a 5 and a ace totalling up to 11.

Determining for one extra card wasn't hard as 2 to 6 cannot go bust and 9 to 11 stands. The probability of busting with 7 is  $\frac{1}{5}$  and the probability of busting with a 8 is  $\frac{2}{5}$ . However, with two extra cards it gets significantly harder. 
 I have written out all the possibilities how, for example, a 3 can go bust with 4 cards. As the only way a 3 can go bust with 4 cards is 3 + 4 + 5, 3 + 5 + 4 or 3 + 5 + 5. Can I just say that if the second card is 4 the dealer only busts with a 5 so we have  $\frac{1}{25}$  ( $\frac{1}{5}$  *  $\frac{1}{5}$ ) and if the second card is a 5 the dealer busts with a 4 or a 5 as the fourth card, so we have  $\frac{2}{25}$  ( $\frac{1}{5}$  *  $\frac{2}{5}$ ). Then combining the two to get a probability of 3/25. I do not think this is correct though, so can someone tell me if this is right and if it is not, how I should calculate it. I hope someone can help me and if something is not clear I will further elaborate. 
 Please note that the third card cannot get the total value to 9, 10 or 11 as the dealer always stands and does not pick a  $4^{th}$  card. 
 Edit 1: I just had a thought. Since we have infinte amount of decks, this is an example of sampling with replacement. Does that make my calculations easier?

 Can anyone give some more examples where a problem which seems to deal entirely with real numbers can be solved using complex numbers behind the scenes?

"So, I need to determine if the integral  $ \intop_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}+4}}-\frac{C}{x+2}\right)dx $  convergent, for any  $ C\in \mathbb{R} $ . 
 I found that for C=1 the integral convergent. I think its easy to show that for  $ C\leq 0 $  the integral will diverge, but I dont know how to determine for the rest of the real values. 
 Here's what I've done: 
 for any  $ 0<t $ 
 $ \intop_{0}^{t}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}+4}}-\frac{C}{x+2}\right)dx=\intop_{0}^{t}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}+4}}dx-\intop_{0}^{t}\frac{C}{x+2}dx=\intop_{0}^{t}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}+4}}dx-C\ln\left(t+2\right)+C\ln2  $ 
 Now, we'll calculate the integral  $ \intop_{0}^{t}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}+4}}dx $ 
 $ \intop_{0}^{t}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}+4}}dx=\intop_{0}^{t}\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{2}+1}}dx $ 
 And let  $ \frac{x}{2}=\sinh u $ 
 so  $ dx=2\cosh udu $ 
 and we get 
 $ \intop_{0}^{t}\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{2}+1}}dx=\intop_{0}^{aricsinh\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)}1du=arcsinh\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)=\ln\left(\frac{t}{2}+\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)^{2}}\right) $ 
 In order to determine if the integal converges, its enough to calculate the limit : 
 $ \lim_{t\to\infty}\left(\ln\left(\frac{t}{2}+\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)^{2}}\right)-c\ln\left(t+2\right)\right) $ 
 If c=1 then the limit will be 0, and thus the integral converge, because we'll have: 
 $ \lim_{t\to\infty}\ln\left(\frac{\frac{t}{2}+\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)^{2}}}{t+2}\right)=\ln\left(1\right)=0 $

   $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ ,  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ ,  $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$ .  
 
 My approach involves replacing substituting all notation with most elementary definitions and trying to isolate particular  $x_i$ , such that  $f(x)$  into a form  $f(x) = x_i^2\cdot c_1 + x_i \cdot c_2 + c_3$ , where  $c_1$ ,  $c_2$  and  $c_3$  are some expressions that don't depend on  $x_i$  and can be treated as constants. Then, since  $i$  is arbitrary, I can make a vector of partial derivatives  $\frac{\delta f}{\delta x_i}$ . 
However, this approach is tedious, requires multiple pages of error-prone derivations, and, judging by the context of the exercise, I'm not meant to do it this way. I wonder, is there a more proper way of approaching such problems, perhaps using row and/or column vectors?

As  $\theta \in \mathbb{R}\setminus \mathbb{Q}$  this basis is a dense subset in  $S^{1}.$

 Heres a counterexample to that with fewer digits. 
 Consider a small example, 2 numbers, and we have to find the 4 most significant digits of the sum. 
 123446 
 234556 
 If we consider only the 5 most significant digits, we get 12344+23455 = 35799 => first 4 = 3579 
 But if we take all 6, we get 123446+234556 = 358002 => first 4 = 3580 
 So why would summing only the 11 most significant digits of each number yield the correct answer? 
 (I have tagged this with modular arithmetic as I suspect its related to that, feel free to correct the tags if not)

 Use Euler’s  $ϕ$ -function to calculate
   $121^{1002}$  mod  $100$ 
  without a calculator. 
 
 I know that  $121^{1002} = (11^2)^{1002}$  =  $11^{2004}$ 
 Applying  $ϕ$ -function to  $11^{2004}$ , we get  $ϕ$  =  $11^{2004}-11^{2003}$  =  $11^{2003}(11-1)$  =  $10 \times 11^{2003}$

"I have a fairly basic question regarding the explicit calculation of the dual norm.

 $$u_t = P'(t)Q(x)$$ 
 $$u_x = P(t)Q'(x)$$ 
 $$u_{xx} = P(t) Q''(x)$$ 
 $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(u^2 \cdot u_x)=2uu_x^2+u^2u_{xx} \quad \Rightarrow \ 2P(t)Q(x)(P(t)Q'(x))^2+(P(t)Q(x))^2P(t)Q''(x)$$ 
 $$q u^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad q P^3(t)Q^3(x)$$ 
 Thus, the RHS looks like this: 
 $$2P(t)Q(x)(P(t)Q'(x))^2+(P(t)Q(x))^2P(t)Q''(x) + P^3(t)Q^3(x)$$ 
 $$2P^3(t)Q(x)(Q'(x))^2+P^3(t)Q^2(x)Q''(x) + P^3(t)Q^3(x)$$ 
 $$P^3(t) \cdot (2Q(x)(Q'(x))^2+Q^2(x)Q''(x)+Q^3(x))$$ 
 The LHS looks like this: 
 $$P'(t)Q(x)$$ 
 As  $Q(x) \neq 0$  (otherwise,  $u = 0$  and that's not what we want), we can divide it by  $Q(x)$  on both sides: 
 $$P'(t) = P^3(t) \cdot (2(Q'(x)^2+Q(x)Q''(x)+Q^2(x))$$

 Maybe we have to make a substitution beforehand? I've written down in my notes that  $k=1, \alpha=2, \beta=3$  but I don't know what their purpose is, I only know that in one example we made the substitution 
 $$u = e^{\alpha} \bar{u}, \quad t = e^{\beta}\bar{t}, \quad x = e^{\gamma} \bar{x} $$

 Intuitively, Y - X and X complement each other when Y is given.
$$ P(X = i |Y = j) = \sum_{j=0} {j\choose i} e^{-2\lambda} \frac{\lambda^j}{j!}$$  $$ =e^{-2\lambda}\frac{\lambda^j}{j!} \sum_{j=0} {j\choose i} $$ 
 $$ P(Y-X=j-i |Y=j) = \sum_{j=0} {j\choose j-i} e^{-2\lambda} \frac{\lambda^j}{j!}$$  $$ =e^{-2\lambda}\frac{\lambda^j}{j!} \sum_{j=0} {j\choose j-i} $$ 
 
 Calculate P(Y-X). 
 
 suppose Y - X = n, x = i
P(Y-X = n) = $$ \sum_{i=0}^n {i+n\choose i} e^{-2\lambda} \frac{\lambda^{i+n}}{(i+n)!} $$ 
 = $$e^{-2\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{n}}{n!} \sum_{i=0}^n\frac{\lambda^i}{i!} $$ 
 = $$e^{-2\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{n}}{n!} e^{\lambda} $$ 
 = $$e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{n}}{n!} $$

"I have a complex math/combination problem I am trying to solve. I am having difficulty summarizing the problem in mathematic notation and determining whether its fundamentally solvable or not. I would like to ask for some input and introductions to relevant math topics that will help me understand the nature of the problem and how to tackle it. 
 The problem: There are 10 cell phones on a single account. Each phone uses a different amount of SMS messages and data per month, somewhere between 0 and infinity. Example: Phone 1 uses 13 SMS and 2MB of data, Phone 2 uses 3 SMS and 15MB of data, etc 
 There are 5 different rate plans I can put each cell phone on. Each rate plan has a price-per-device, a maximum SMS use, and a maximum data use. 
 Example: Plan A price-per-sim = 1.20USD, max SMS use=20, maximum data use=2MB Plan B price-per-sim = 3.25USD, maximum SMS use = 150, maximum data use = 10MB 
 Each rate plan ""pools"" the maximum SMS use and maximum data use between all lines within each plan. If the plan's total SMS use is over its pooled SMS use, the extra is charged at 0.05USD/SMS. If the plan's total data use is over its pooled data use, the extra is charged at 0.35USD/MB 
 Example: 3 phones are on plan A use a total of 75 SMS and 10MB of data. Service charge = 3 *  $1.2 = 3.60USD, Pooled SMS = 3 * 20 = 60, overage = 75-60=15 SMS * 0.05USD = $ .75 overage, Pooled data = 3 * 2MB = 6MB, overage = 10MB - 6MB = 4MB *  $.35 = $ 1.40 overage Total plan A cost = 3.60USD + 0.75USD + 1.40USD = 5.75USD Total cost of the account would be that same process for all the rate plans. 
 I can make the change right up until the last day of the month, and whatever plan the phone is on at the end of the month will be used to calculate that month's use/overage. So my ultimate question is ""What plan should each phone be on that will give me the lowest total account bill?"" 
 The equation for computing the overall bill is easy, but how can I represent ""for every phone on the account, look up the rate plan and do this computation"". Also, is there a way to compute the absolute minimum for this problem separate from computing every possible combination of phone and rate plan?

p2 ( 100,-10,20)
 
 we get the points inside the cylinder ( 0,20,0) [ which is actually the cylinder formed by ( 0,0,0) and (0,20,0) ] 
 certainly, I'm missing something, can anyone point it out?  
 N.B: For some complicated reason, I can't use an auxiliary coordinate system or shift the origin. What I'm looking for is some pure mathematical expression ( if it exists ), which can take the particulars of the cylinder and the required point and give if it is inside or outside.

"I think I just need to be pushed to the right formula or algorithm... Imagine you've got a ""real"" dice which is not an optimal one. And you want to know the confidence intervals for each result. So you rolled the dice a couple of times and get the following absolute probabilities as result: 
 #eyes #occurrences
------------------

2     11
3     24
4     13
5     14

 You actually want to know weather e.g. this 24 times 3 eyes is just a random result or weather it's really more probable. If so, how much more probable is it (for sure)? So I would like to calculate a 99%-confidence interval for the probabilities. 
 How to calculate this? I probably know this from statistics in university, but just forgot it... so you don't need to go to much into detail. Just need the right formula/algorithm to look for...

Just to make clear, why I do not just lookup ""Confidence Interval"" at wikipedia. I would know how to calculate everything if there would be only two cases (e.g. like a coin... 0 and 1).

"What I have is sums of smaller submatrices of size $M\times M$ ($M$ is much smaller than $N$, say $N/6$ or less). The sums of all possible submatrices at all positions are known. I am trying to rebuild the entire $N\times N$ matrix. 
 For example, if there is a $4\times 4$ matrix $X$ with the values 
 $$\begin{array}{cccc} 
 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
 5 & 6 & 7 & 8\\
 9 & 1 & 2 & 3\\
 4 & 5 & 6 & 7\\
\end{array}$$ 
 And I have the sums of submatrices of size $2\times 2$ (for all possible positions - assuming that the matrix is surrounded by infinite number of zero values). 
 The first known submatrix sum would thus be $0+0+0+1=1$:
$$\hskip-0.3in \begin{array}{ccccc} 
\fbox{$\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{matrix}$}\!\!\!\! & {\atop 2} & {\atop 3} & {\atop 4}\\
 \begin{matrix} \hphantom{0} & 5\end{matrix}\!\!\!\! & 6 & 7 & 8\\
 \begin{matrix} \hphantom{0} & 9\end{matrix}\!\!\!\! & 1 & 2 & 3\\
 \begin{matrix} \hphantom{0} & 4\end{matrix}\!\!\!\! & 5 & 6 & 7\\
\end{array}$$ 
 ...and the second submatrix sum, $0+0+1+2=3$: 
 $$\begin{array}{cccc} 
\fbox{$\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 2\end{matrix}$}\!\!\!\!\!\! & {\atop 3} & {\atop 4} \\
 \begin{matrix} 5 & 6\end{matrix}\!\!\!\!\!\! & 7 & 8\\
 \begin{matrix} 9 & 1\end{matrix}\!\!\!\!\!\! & 2 & 3\\
 \begin{matrix} 4 & 5\end{matrix}\!\!\!\!\!\! & 6 & 7\\
\end{array}$$ 
 The third sum would be $5$, the fourth $7$, and so on for each row and column in $X$. There are $(N+1)\times(N+1)$ of these sums, and they can be written as the matrix $Y$ (containing all available submatrix sums): 
 $$\begin{matrix} 
1 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 4\\

13 & 19& 14& 18&10 \\
4 & 9& 11&13 & 7
\end{matrix}$$

"all - 
 I'm trying to figure out if this can be done at all, and if so, how; unfortunately, my skill set isn't up to the task, and I'm hoping to find an answer here - or at least guidance on how to approach it. 
 I need to score a 10-question test that has weighted questions on a pass/fail basis, with 70% as the cut score. So far, so good - sum the total difficulties, multiply by 0.7, then check to see if the candidate's score is above or below (the framework we are using does all this automatically.) However, I now want to add another condition: if the candidate does a certain thing (something I can test for), I need the score to always be a fail (below 70%.) 
 Changing the scoring framework to do this would be problematic in lots of ways - but treating the condition test as a hidden 11th question would be trivial. The challenge, then, is this: 
 Given 10 questions with associated difficulty scores (as below), is it possible to calculate a difficulty score for question #11 such that failing it will produce a score below 70% in all cases, but passing it will result in the same pass/fail rate as if q#11 wasn't present?  The weight can't be negative. 
 Hopefully, I've managed to phrase this in a coherent manner; please feel free to ask any questions you need to clarify.

 However we cannot easily compute this value, so we scale $X$ resulting in a new RV $Z = \frac {X - \mu} {\sigma} \sim N(0,1)$.

Numerically it is easy to see that it follows a logistic-like curve of initial accelerating growth that levels off.  
 My question is whether  $y$  properly asymptotes? 
 The RHS is always positive and nonzero, but declines strongly with increasing  $y$ . Is the positivity enough to prove lack of asymptoticity? 
 Trying to solve the equation gives me the expression $$t+C = \int_1^y e^u u^{-\alpha} du$$  where symbolic integrators happily tell me the RHS is  $(-1)^\alpha [\Gamma(1-\alpha, -y) - \Gamma(1-\alpha,-1)]$  (with the incomplete gamma function) or  $E_\alpha(-1)-y^{1-\alpha}E_\alpha(-y)$  (with the exponential integral  $E_n(x)=\int_1^\infty e^{-xu}u^{-\alpha}du$ ). Both answers are confusing since the exponential integral looks divergent for negative  $x$  and at least Matlab refuses to calculate the incomplete gamma function for doubly negative arguments. Numerically the integral is of course well behaved. 
 At the same time, squinting hard, if  $t+C \approx \Gamma(y)$  then we have an answer since we know  $y$  grows as the inverse of the factorial of time, i.e. absurdly slowly yet without bound.  
 I have a feeling that there is either a simple way of proving lack of asymptote, or that one can juggle the special functions into something more illuminating, that I am simply not seeing.

"Two pizzas are each divided into eight slices and placed inside separate boxes with the
lids closed, and left in an empty room. People randomly arrive at the room to take a slice.
Each person who arrives randomly chooses a box, opens it, takes a slice of pizza and closes
the box. If all eight slices from a box are taken then the lid is not closed. 
 The first person to discover an empty box opens the other box. Calculate the probability
that it contains all eight slices. 
 The answer says  $\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^8$ . This is what I intuitively thought, until my friend posed the solution  $\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^7$  as he is looking at the problem from the standpoint that all the others have to do is pick the same box as the first person, and it doesn't matter which box the first person chooses.

"I am working on some things related to arithmetic derivatives, and I was writing a program to calculate the arithmetic derivative. In working on my program I came across an assumption that I have made, but I could not prove that it was true and it was quite frustrating to me.  
 My hypothesis is for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the smallest number, $a \in \mathbb{N}/\{1\}$ such that $a \vert n$ should be prime. My beginning of a proof for this was this 
 Using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}/\{1\}$, that either $n$ is prime, or that $n$ has a unique prime factorization. If $n$ is prime, the proof is trivial, as the prime factorization for all $p \in \mathbb{P}$ is just $p$; however, for the case of $n$ being composite, the proof became quite difficult for me.  
 For the case of a number $c$ such that $c \in \mathbb{N}/\{1\}$ and $c \notin \mathbb{P}$, we can say that there exists at least two numbers, $a$ and $b$ such that fulfill the following four statement 
 
 $1 < a \le b < c$ 
 $a \vert c$ 
 $b \vert c$ 
 $ab = c$ 
 
 My thought process thereby went into dividing $c$ into odds and evens. We can say that this theorem is true for all even numbers, $e$, rather trivially as well because for all $e \in \{2k:\mathbb{N}/\{1\}\}$ that $2\vert e$ and $2$ is also the smallest integer that could possibly fulfill the above criteria thereby making $a = 2$ and fulfilling the theorem for all even numbers. 
 The part that I cannot figure out however is odd numbers. My intuition is telling me this must be true, but I cannot figure out a proof of this theorem for odds and I was wondering if  
 
 Is this theorem actually true? 
 If so, how can this be proven for odds?

 c) Repeat using $\Delta t = 0.05$

 e) Repeat parts b, c, and d with Improved euler's method using the same step sizes 
 f) Repeat using Runge-Kutta 
 g) Calculate the error in each case, since we now have 9 different approx for the value of $x(1) = e$, three for each method.

"I came across this problem in the context of spectroscopy today.  Because of it's simplicity, I'm sure it's a question that's been posed by some mathematician ages ago, I just can't figure out how to formulate it mathematically: 
 Suppose you have a mirror that forms a perfect ring and has an aperture in it with width $\delta w$.  A ray of light enters the aperture at angle $\theta$ relative to the tangent at the aperture.  There are several questions that I have regarding this system, some of which would be of practical use and some of which are mere curiosity: 
 
 Is this a chaotic system?  I know a little about chaotic systems from my undergrad math major, and this looks like one to me, but I don't know where to start working on it if it is. 
 How can this problem be formulated mathematically?  I would assume that there is some sort of iterated function approach, but I can't figure out what the iterated function would be (probably because as a chemist I'm more comfortable with cartesian coordinates than polar coordinates). 
 What is the optimal angle for achieving the most passes through the area within some $\epsilon$ of the center of the ring before exiting through the aperture, assuming (a) $\epsilon$ is small compared to $r$, the radius of the ring, or (b) $\epsilon$ is not small compared to the radius of the ring?  (This is one of the questions of practical importance) 
 Bonus:  Suppose there is a second aperture placed at an angle $\phi$ away from the first (with $\phi$ relative to the center of the circle and to the first aperture).  Can this angle be optimized in conjunction with the variables in $\phi$? 
 
 To summarize, the variables are $r$, $\theta$, $\delta w$, $\epsilon$, and (if we're lucky) $\phi$.  Assume that $\epsilon$ and $\delta w$ are given (obviously the optimal size for $\delta w$ is infinitesimal, but this isn't practical of course).  Also (for the physicists out there), assume $\delta w$ is wide enough that the beam can be treated classically, i.e. no diffraction.  Also, there needs to be a reasonable way to calculate the exit angle based on the entry angle (if this is a truly chaotic system, I realize this will be practically impossible). 
 Thanks in advance for any help, and let me know if I've left out any important details.  I'm comfortable with any math that a typical undergraduate math major should know by the time they graduate; anything more and I'll need a reference to read up on.

 I'm in design phase of a hobby electronics project and need your help. Basically, I'm going to have two platforms with electronics on both of them. I'm planning to have a  stepper motor  on the bottom platform which will be connected to top platform by an axle. I plan to use a microcontroller to precisely control the intensity of angular velocity of the motor and the angle by which it will rotate. I will also need to use wires to connect the bottom platform to the top platform. My idea is to have wires run on the outside of the axle and be long enough that the axle will be able to rotate by some angle of $±θ$. In normal operation the angle shouldn't be grater than 2π, so I want to avoid constructing some complex mechanism which will transfer current irrelevant of the axle's rotation. 
 Image (I apologize for my bad drawing skills) shows the two states which are interesting (at least in my opinion) here. The top is when the axle is in neutral position and angle by which it is rotated is 0. While the image does not show it, the wire will be loose. The bottom image shows what I expect will happen after the axle has been rotated by a certain angle. 
The two black rectangles are soldering joints by which the cable will be connected to the bottom and the top platforms. The red line is wire.

"Right now I'm stuck on the following problem, since I feel like I should be using total probability, but I dont know what numbers to use as what. 
 Let's say there's a population of students. In this population:

 10% have a motorcycle 
 12% have a car. 
 8% have a bike AND a motorcycle 
 7% car and a bike 
 4% have a motorcycle and a car 
 2% have a bike, a car and a motorcycle 
 What percentage of students owns no vehicles?

"I'm trying to determine 'how much' (as a percentage) a 2D rectangle fills a 2D circle.  
 Actual Application: 
 I was comparing the accuracy of some computer game weapons by calculating the max possible dispersion from the weapon's shell origion at a given range. After that, I added a player stand in to help visualize the possible dispersion vs size of the target. Of course I can eyeball the values, but I don't know how to calculate this geometry (as the player's head and feet would not actually be inside the dispersion area, so a basic area calculation is not accurate). 
 Any guidance is appreciated. 
 UPDATE: 
 I'm sorry that the question was not more clear, I'll try to elaborate: 
 In the case of the smaller circle, if you did a basic area calculation of the circle (1.828) and the rectangle (1.6), the result would say that the rectangle fills ~87% of the circle. However, the person cannot be compacted, and their upper body and lower body do not fall within the circle, and therefore the result is not accurate. 
 Now I think all I need to do is to subtract the difference of the circle's diameter from the max extents of the rectangle (so 2m - 1.526 = 0.474, or in other words, just make the rectangle as tall as the circle's diameter) making the rectangle's new area 1.526 * 0.8. Making the new percentage ~69%, which should be much more accurate. Am I on the right track? 
 Image:

 Player: 2m tall, 0.8m wide.

 Weapon Dispersion Circle B (red): radius = 1.05.

"I have a lock on my dorm door that's really stupid. Basically, it just checks whether or not the sequence of numbers I've put in is the combo, whether or not the lock was reset between guesses. So let's say my combo is 5556. Then I can input 555555556 into my lock and it'll unlock, without having to reset after inputting the first four numbers.  
 I tried to calculate the expected number of random number guesses to eventually input the right combo by assuming each ""guess"" was independent. For example, the input of 123454321 has 6 ""guesses"": 1234, 2345, 3454, 4543, 5432, 4321. Assuming this, the expected length of input required would be 10,000, for 10^4 permutations of a 4 digit combo. 
 However, to check my work, I created a simulation with a queue object and random number generators and ran 100 trials per experiment over 100 experiments in Python. In every experiment, the average was always above 10,000 by a significant margin, ranging from 500-2000.  
 I'm wondering, are the guesses really independent? What is the actual expected value?

"Problem:  Given the square $ABCD$, let $M$ be the midpoint on the side $|CD|$ and designate $\alpha=\angle AMB$. Calculate $\tan{\alpha}.$ 
 Attempt:  We can, without compromising generality, assume that the side of the square is equal to 1. So drawing a figure we get 
 
 
 I know the following:  
 1)  That $|AM|=|BM|=\sqrt{1^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}.$ 
 2)  The area of $ABM$ can be expressed in two ways. One way with normal geometry for triangle and another way is by using the areakit involving $\sin{\alpha}$. So: $$\begin{array}{lcl}
A_1 & = & \frac{1\cdot 1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \\
A_2 & = & \frac{|AM|\cdot|BM|\cdot\sin{\alpha}}{2} = \frac{5}{2}\cdot\sin{\alpha} \\
\end{array}$$ 
 3)  I know that $\tan{\alpha}=\frac{\sin{\alpha}}{\cos{\alpha}},$ so finding $\sin{\alpha}$ and $\cos{\alpha}$ and dividing these two will solve this problem. 
 
 Setting $A_1=A_2$ yields the equation $$\frac{5}{2}\sin{\alpha}=\frac{1}{2} \ \Longleftrightarrow \ \sin{\alpha} = \frac{1}{5}.$$ 
 Using the law of cosines in the triangle $ABM$ I get  
 $$\begin{array}{lcl}
|AB|^2 & = & |AM|^2+|BM|^2 -2|AM||BM|\cos{\alpha} \\
1 & = & \sqrt{5}-\sqrt{5}\cos{\alpha} \ \Leftrightarrow \ \cos{\alpha} = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{\sqrt{5}} \\
\end{array}$$ 
 And finally we have $$\tan{\alpha}=\frac{\sin{\alpha}}{\cos{\alpha}}=\frac{\frac{1}{5}}{\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{\sqrt{5}}} = \frac{5+\sqrt{5}}{20}.$$

 If rotations and/or reflections are allowed then the number of distinct tiles is much reduced. If paths are allowed to merge when they cross the number is quite a bit higher. Perhaps the question has 3 different answers, but the answer I'm most interested in is the distinct paths on fixed tiles.

 $$S \enspace = \enspace \int_0^{\infty} f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x + \int_{\infty}^0 f(-y) \, \mathrm{d}(-y) \enspace = \enspace \int_0^{\infty} f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x + \int_{\infty}^0 f(y) \, \mathrm{d}(y) \enspace = \enspace \int_0^{\infty} f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x - \int_{0}^{\infty} f(y) \, \mathrm{d}(y) \enspace = \enspace 0$$

Daniel comes  $3$  minutes before the bus is supposed to arrive the earliest. 
 
 Calculate the possibility that Daniel waits more than  $6$  min. 
 
 My solution: 
 Let  $X$  be a random variable that describes the delay of the bus, we know that  $X\thicksim\operatorname{Uni}(0,10)$  and that for sure he will wait at least  $3$  min so we calculate  $P(X>3)$ :
 $$P(X>3)=\int_3^\infty f(x)\,dx.$$ 
Now we can replace  $\infty$  with  $10$  since  $f(x)=0$  for  $x>10$  (Probability density function) thus getting  $7/10$ . 
 
 In a specific day Daniel woke up late and arrived to the bus station in a delay of  $4$  minutes.

 Daniel will miss the bus if it arrived in the first  $4$  minutes so:

"So I'm building a Post-Turing Machine that's running a 5-state busy beaver. It has a 300ft roll of receipt paper at each end simulating an infinite tape.  
 Hypothetically the tape is divided into 'cells.'  So the machine writes or erases a 1 on the tape under the writing head, then the tape shifts either 2"" to the right or 2"" to the left. 
 I have a stepper motor (Nema 17) at each end hooked to each roll. 
 Finally, my question: As you can imagine turning both motors a given number of steps will initially will move the tape evenly 2"", however now one roll has 2"" more and the other, 2"" less. Not such a big difference now but as it goes on one roll could have 500ft and the other 100ft, making the one with 500ft have a much larger radius, therefore turning the motor the same amount will release much more tape...Does anyone know a way to calculate these changing ratios so the motors will always work together in letting out/winding 2"" of tape?

"A company provides each of its employees with a death benefit of 100. The company purchases insurance that pays the cost of total death benefits in excess of 400 per year. The number of employees who will die during the year is a Poisson random variable with mean 2.

"The question is basically we have a continuous function  $f:R\to R$  in which we have  $$f(x)=\int_0^xf$$  for all real x, and it asks us to show that  $f(x) = 0$  for all x real. 
 The major drawback for me is that I only have theorems about derivatives and Taylor/power series (without the use of integrals), some integral propeties (like the ones which relates absolute values, sums, subtractions, I haven't got theorems about change of variable or integration by parts, for example) and the first statement from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to use: (no mention to differential equations nor the second statement of the FTC) 
 If  $f:[a,b]\to R$  is a continuous function and  $F:[a,b]\to R$  is defined as  $$F(x) = \int_a^xf$$  for all  $x\in[a,b]$ . Then we have  $F'(x) = f(x)$  for all  $x\in (a,b)$ . 
 All those integrals are defined with the Darboux definition which takes into account  $sup$  and  $inf$  of  $f$  in each interval that we partition and then take the  $sup$  and  $inf$  of the lower and upper sums to calculate the integral. (So we're not using the Rienmann definition) 
 I thought that I could use the fact that the function is infinitely-derivable since  $f'(x) = f(x)$  because of the first part of FTC, then  $f^{(n)}(x) = f(x)$  and, since  $f(0) = 0$  (because it's a degenerate interval for the integral), we'd have  $f^{(n)}(0) = 0$  for all natural  $n$ , then I thought that I could use the Taylor series for the function  $f$  around  $x=0$  which would be simply  $T(x) = 0$  for all real  $x$ , but then I'd need to proof that  $f$  is analytic for all real  $x$ , which I don't know how to... And the only theorem that my book has about that idea of being analytic is this one: 
 Let  $f:I\to R$  be an infinitely-derivable function in a interval  $I$  which contains  $0$  in its interior. Let  $(-r,r)$  be the biggest open interval in that form such that it's contained in  $I$  and such that for each  $c$  with  $0<c<r$  we have:  $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left[\frac{1}{n!}M_n(c)c^n \right] = 0,$$  where  $M_n(c)$  is the maximum of the function  $f^{(n)}(x)$  in the interval  $[-c,c]$ . Then the Taylor series of the function  $f(x)$ , relatively to  $x=0$ , converges to  $f(x)$  in the interval  $(-r,r)$ . 
 But honestly, I don't exactly know how to proceed with my idea of proof using that theorem... any idea would be very welcome and appreciated!

"The  half-normal  distribution is a special case of the  folded normal distribution . If $X$ follows an ordinary normal distribution $N(0, \sigma^{2})$, then $Y = |X|$ follows a half-normal distribution.  
 The probability density function associated with a half-normal distribution $Y$ is is given by: $$f_{Y} (y, \sigma) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sigma \sqrt{\pi}} e^{-
 \frac{y^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}} \quad .$$ 
 Let $H(0, \sigma^{2})$ denote the half-normal distribution. Let $Y_{1} \sim H(0, \sigma_{1}^{2}) $ and $Y_{2} \sim H(0, \sigma_{2}^{2})$. I'd like to figure out what the probability density function is that is associated with the sum of these two random variables: $Z = Y_{1} + Y_{2}$. In other words, I want to compute the  convolution  $h(z) = f_{Z} (z) = (f_{Y_{1}} * f_{Y_{2}}) (z)$.  
 Here's what I tried so far:

&= \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} f(t) g(z-t) dt  \\

&= \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sigma_{1} \sigma_{2}} \cdot \frac{2}{\pi} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \big{(}\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}z^{2} + (\sigma_{1}^{2} + \sigma_{2}^{2})t^{2} - 2 \sigma \sigma_{1}^{2} t}{\sigma_{1}^{2} \sigma_{2}^{2}} \big{)}} dt \\
&=  \frac{1}{\sigma_{1} \sigma_{2}} \cdot \frac{2}{\pi} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \big{(} \frac{\sigma_{1}^{2} z^{2}}{\sigma_{1}^{2} \sigma_{2}^{2}} \big{)}} \int_{\ -\infty}^{\infty} e^{- \frac{1}{2} \big{(} \frac{(\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2})t^{2} - 2 \sigma_{1}^{2}t}{\sigma_{1}^{2} \sigma_{2}^{2}} \big{)}} dt \qquad (1) \\

\end{split}
\end{equation} .$ 
 In $(2)$, $erf(\cdot)$ is the so-called  error function . I have to admit I did not calculate the integral in $(1)$ (which yielded equality $(2)$) myself; I did it with Wolframalpha (see the calculation  here , with $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ changed to $a$ and $b$ respectively for convenience).  
 After having arrived at equality $(3)$, I don't know how to proceed anymore. If $\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{\sigma_{2}^{2}(\sigma_{1}^{2} + \sigma_{2}^{2})} $ in the exponent would have been multiplied by $z^{2}$, then it seems I would get close to showing that $Z \sim H(0, \sigma_{1}^{2} + \sigma_{2}^{2})$, but the whole calculation does not support the validity of this extra multiplication (and there's still the extra factor $2$ to be dealt with).  
 I have a number of questions:  
 
 
 Did I make a mistake somewhere in my calcuations? Or should I perhaps have done something a bit different in one or more steps? 
 Did Wolframalpha perhaps make a mistake in calculating equation $(1)$ ?  
 Is there perhaps an (other) way to calculate the convolution of two half-normal distributions? Perhaps by means of Laplace/Fourier transforms and the convolution theorem? Can you show it over here directly or can you point me towards an external reference?

 Goal: explicitly find a nilpotent element of the group algebra $\Bbb C G$ for some finite group $G$. This exists if and only if $G$ is non abelian by Maschke's theorem and Wedderburn-Artin. 
 
 By Maschke's theorem, the group algebra $\Bbb C G$ is semisimple for finite $G$. So for any non-abelian group $G$, there is a nontrivial Wedderburn component, and thus  nilpotent elements. 
 Take $G=D_{8}$, the dihedral group or order $8$. Then $G$ is non-abelian and we know that the irreducible representations have dimensions $1,1,1,1$, and $2$. Thus
$$\Bbb C G\cong \Bbb C^{\oplus 4}\oplus M_2(\Bbb C)$$
and under this map we have nilpotent elements like
$$\left(0,0,\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix} \right).$$ 
 In theory, then, we should be able to find nilpotent elements in $\Bbb C G$. We know they exist, but we don't know the actual correspondence $\Bbb C G\tilde \to \Bbb C^{\oplus 4}\oplus M_2(\Bbb C)$. 
 
 My only lead: there is a well-known result we can use to calculate central primitive idempotents. For $D_8$, with the presentation 
 $$D_8=\langle a,b: a^4=b^2=abab=1\rangle,$$
the element corresponding to the $2\times 2$ identity matrix (i.e., the element $(0,0,\text{Id}_2)$), is
$$\frac{1}{2}(1-a^2).$$ 
 But this is not really helpful, and I still have no leads on how to get the element $\left(0,0,\begin{pmatrix}0,& 1\\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}\right)$ for example. 
 
 I have done all of the guess work I can. For the case $G=D_8$, a nilpotent must square to $0$, so I checked elements of the form $\sum_{G}^8c_ig$ for $c_i\in\{-3,-2,1,0,1,2,3\}$ with no luck. If there are no ""easy"" nilpotent elements, then I will need to get more clever with the search. 
 
 Note: there is nothing special about $D_8$. I just picked it because the two dimensional representation was easy to start playing with by hand in the first place.

At 12 o'clock we have 0° and 360°, at 3 o'clock we have 90, at 6 o'clock we have 180, at 9 am have 270, ie, the angles range from 0 to 360° clockwise ALWAYS. This is my reference. 
 Each hour is 30 degrees (360/12), so suppose one of hands is in position 1h and the other one is in position 11h. Using my reference, which always starts at zero from 0 hours (or 12 hours, whichever you prefer) we have: 
 1h Position is equivalent to 30°
11h position is equivalent to 330°

 The first example can be expanded to : $3-\frac{17}{2x}+\frac{13}{x^2}-\frac{247}{12 x^3}+\frac{168}{5x^4}$ 
 The second one can be expanded to : $1-\frac1x+\frac{2}{3 x^2}-\frac{2}{3x^3}+\frac{2}{3 x^4}$ 
 Is it true? How can we do that ?

"I have two random variables $X,Y$ which are independent and uniformly distributed on $(\frac{1}{2},1]$. Then I consider two more random variables, $D=|X-Y|$ and $Z=\log\frac{X}{Y}$. I would like to calculate both, the disitrbution functions $F_D(t), F_Z(t)$ and the the density functions $f_D(t),f_Z(t)$ 
 To do that I think the first thing we need to do is to evaluate the density of the common distribution of $X$ and $Y$, but I do not know how to do that. 
 The only thing which is clear to me is the density and distribution function of $X$ and $Y$ because we know that they are uniform.

"Let $A: \mathcal{C}\left(\left[a,b\right]\right) \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $Af := f(b) - f(a)$. This is a linear functional between the space of continuous functions from the interval $[a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ to the reals. I'm supposed to show that $A$ is bounded and calculate its the norm given by 
 
 $\|A\| := \operatorname{sup}\{\; |Af| \; : \; f \in \mathcal{C}\left(\left[a,b\right]\right)\;\;\textrm{and} \;\; \|f\| = 1 \;\}$. 
 
 Since $[a,b]$ is a compact set  $\|f\| = 1 \Leftrightarrow \max_{x\in [a,b]} |f(x)| = 1$. I think this implies that for any such $f$ we have that $|Af| = |f(b) - f(a)| \leq 2$. A function, for which this upper bound is attained is given by  $f(x) = sin(x)$ on $[a,b] = [\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}]$. With this in mind I would assume that $\| A \| = 2$. However, this is of course very hand-wavy and I'm not sure if it is correct at all. Also I'm at a loss on how to prove that $A$ is bounded. I know that a continuous function $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ must attain its maximum/minimum, so we can give an estimate of $|Af|$ for a particular $f$. But how can this be done for  all  continuous functions on $[a,b]$?

"This is  Example 5j, from Sheldon Ross's First Course in Probability 8th ed, page 38. I don't understand why the following is true. 
 Solution .To determine the probability that the card following the first ace is the aceof spades, we need to calculate how many of the (52)! possible orderings of the cardshave the ace of spades immediately following the first ace. To begin, note that  each ordering of the 52 cards can be obtained by first ordering the 51 cards different from the ace of spades and then inserting the ace of spades into that ordering. 
 I don't see how this (sentence in italics) can be true. For example if we have  $S=\{ 1, 2, 3\} $  the number of orderings that can be obtained are  $3!=6$ . Following the solution's reasoning we could calculate the orderings for  $S$  by ordering the cards different form  $3$  and then inserting in into that ordering, that is  $ 2!$  .
What am I missing? perhaps the sentence in italics does not mean what I think it does? 
 Also, the solution given is a probability of  $ \frac{1}{52} $  for both, I understand why but I have a different solution that also seems valid: 
 My solution 
 
 Ordering in which the card following the first ace is the ace of spades ;
We have 3 other aces so we put  $A_i A_s  $ ,  with  $i = c, d, h $ ,  together as one unit  and count the number of permutations   $ = 51! $ . As we have three of these such pairs  $$ P(N_a) = \dfrac{3\cdot 51!}{52!} $$ 
 
 Ordering in which the card following the first ace is the two of clubs  By a similar argument we put  $A_i A_s  $ ,  with  $i = c, d, h, s$ , so
 $$ P(N_c) = \dfrac{4\cdot 51!}{52!} $$

"I'm trying to understand a proof on Steklov average and weak derivatives.
Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $T>0$, $h\neq 0$ and $u\in L^2(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$ and extend $u$ by zero. The Steklov average in time of a function $f \in L^1$ is defined as
$$f_h(t) :=\frac{1}{h} \int_t^{t+h} f(x,s) ds$$ 
 I want to prove that $\partial_{x_j} u_h =(\partial_{x_j} u)_h$ for every $h\neq 0$ and a.e. $(x,t)\in\Omega\times (0,T)$.
Up to this point, the right hand side of the result is well defined.
Hence my approach is to calculate the weak derivative of $u_h$. Hence let $\phi\in C_c^\infty((0,T)\times \Omega)$ and we start with (the integrals may be extended due to the domain of the functions) 
 \begin{aligned}
\int_\Omega\int_0^T \partial_j u_h(x,t) \phi(x,t) = -\int_\Omega \int_0^T u_h(x,t) \partial_j \phi(x,t) = -\frac{1}{h}\int_\Omega \int_0^T \int_0^T \chi_{[t,t+h]}(s) u(x,s) \partial_j \phi(x,t) 
\end{aligned}
Now using Fubini's theorem and exploiting that $\chi_{[t,t+h]}(s)=\chi_{[s-h,s]}(t)$ we can put the Steklov average on the tesfunction $\partial_j \phi(x,t)$ 
 Thus 
$$...=-\frac{1}{h}\int_\Omega \int_0^T  u(x,s) \int_{s-h}^{s}\partial_j \phi(x,t) =-\frac{1}{h}\int_\Omega \int_0^T  u(x,s) \partial_j\int_{s-h}^{s} \phi(x,t) $$
The last step follows since $\phi$ is smooth and consequently we can apply the Leibniz rule.
I hope until this point everything is correct. Now I want to integrate by parts and exploit that $u$ has a weak derivative and then put the Steklov Average again on $w:=u_j$. 
 However the definition of weak derivative requires that $\int w \phi=-\int u\phi_j$. The part hat I have problems with is, that $\int_{s-h}^s \phi$ may leave the space $C_c^\infty((0,T)\times \Omega)$ and consequently I need to choose $h$ prior to $\phi$ but then I'm not able to verify the definition of weak solution (since not all $\phi$ occur) 
 If there is something unclear feel free to ask and hopefully it's just really easy :)

"I'm trying to calculate the number of ""participant*hours"" for participation in a program.  
 I have the following variables/data:
1) Total # of sessions given throughout the program.
2) Average duration (in hours) of each session.
3) Average # of participants in each session. 
 So, for example, if 84 sessions were given with a duration of 0.75 hours per session, and about 25 participants per session, what would be the proper way of calculating a figure with the units ""participant*hours""? 
 By simple multiplication and unit cancelation, it seems the calculation should be: 
 Total hours = (84 sessions)*(0.75 hours / session) = 63 hours 
 Total # of participants = (84 sessions)*(25 participants / session) = 2,100 participants 
 (2,100 participants) (63 hours) = 132,300 participant hours

"Consider  $f = x^5 -11x + 1 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ . I want to prove that its not solvable by radicals. I know that its solvable by radicals iff its galois group is solvable. My attempt was first to use the following: 
 For any prime  $p$  not dividing the discriminant of  $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$  , the galois group of  $f$  over  $\mathbb{Q}$  contains an element with cyclic decomposition  $(n_1,..,n_k)$  where  $n_1,...,n_k$  are the degrees of the irreducible factors of  $f$  reduced mod  $p$ . 
 Then, I could use this to determine the galois group of  $f$ . However, the discriminant proved to be super hard to calculate (wolfram alpha works but its not intended to be used). So I am thinking that I got the wrong approach here. Any other hints?

"I am attempting to calculate the round constants used in AES. Using the formula found on Wikipedia's  Rijndael Key Schedule  page results in answers that the same page says are correct, but the primary source for my current project gives a different formula, so I feel like I might be missing something. 
 The formula given is: $r(i) = x^{(i-4)/4} mod (x^8+x^4+x^3+x+1)$ where $i$ is the current round. It seems to me that this formula and the one listed on the Wikipedia page for  Rcon , which I'm assuming is short for ""round constant,"" have the same purpose, but one uses values four times as high. For reference, the Wikipedia function is $Rcon(i) = b^{i-1}$ in $GF(2^8)$. 
 The project requires that I calculate the value of r for all i divisible by 4 from 4 to 40. My solutions for 4 to 32 match the values given for  Rcon(1)  to  Rcon(8)  (01 to 80) in the linked article.

"If we consider that  
 $$\nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) = -4\pi\delta(\vec{r})$$ 
 we can explain the dirac-delta function here via the results of Gauss' law
$$\int_V \nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) = \int_S\nabla\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\cdot d\vec{a} = \int_S \frac{-\hat{r}}{r^2}\cdot d\vec{a} = -4\pi\frac{R^2}{r^2} $$ 
 where the surface integral has been taken over a sphere of radius $R$. Now, if we say $r>0$ and $R\to 0$, we get 
$$\int_V \nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) = 0. $$
Furthermore, if we set $r=R$ and send $R\to0$ we get 
$$\int_V \nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) = -4\pi $$ 
 Thus we have demonstrated the validity of the first equation. However, if we were to directly calculate the Laplacian of $\frac 1r$ we obtain
$$\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial }{\partial r}\left(r^2\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\right) = 0$$  
 So it seems like the -$4\pi\delta(\vec{r})$ has somehow been neglected by the direct calculation. That being said, what about the case where we have, for some $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R} > 0$ 
 $$\nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r^\epsilon}\right) = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial }{\partial r}\left(r^2\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{1}{r^\epsilon}\right)\right) = \frac{(\epsilon-1)\epsilon}{r^{\epsilon+2}}$$

 Backstory 
 Yesterday, I was driving through California's Central Valley, thinking about how most of the roads there are orthogonal, directed north-south or east-west, creating some sort of square grid. Similar pattern to one found in many American cities and towns, with square grid layouts. 
 Here is a snapshot from Google Maps near Turlock, CA 
 
 I had driving directions on, and wondered for a bit about how an algorithm would calculate the shortest/fastest path when traveling ""diagonally"" (northeast -> southwest, for example). I didn't spend too much time on that, since some of these roads have different features, speed limits, etc. 
 Instead, I started thinking about different ways to calculate the distance between opposite corners of a square or rectangle (for simplification, I will focus on squares moving forward, but the math applies to both). 
 Pythagoras 
 We know that using Pythagoras, we can calculate the hypotenuse as the square root of the sum of the sides squared: 
 $ h = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $ 
 Thus, for a 10 by 10 square, the hypotenuse will be the square root of 200: 14.1421... 
 Not Pythagoras 
 Ok, now, consider this. Given a 10 by 10 square (think of a city block, or orthogonal roads like the ones above), if we want to travel from one corner (A) to the opposite corner (B), first we need to visit one of the remaining two corners. 
 
 In this case, the distance traveled would be  10 + 10 = 20  (much longer than the 14.14 hypotenuse). 
 Now, if we divide this square into 4 equal squares, and we travel through the center, the distance traveled will remain the same:  5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 units . 
 
 The number of horizontal segments is equal to the number of columns (2 in this case). 
 The length of each horizontal segment is equal to the width divided the number of columns: 
 $ s_h = \frac{width}{columns} $ 
 Thus, the distance traveled horizontally  $ d_h $  would be  $ s_h * columns $ , or in other words, equal to the total  width . 
 The same applies to the distance traveled vertically  $ d_v $ , where the total distance will be equal to the total  height . 
 $ d_h = columns * \frac{width}{columns} = width $ 
 $ d_v = rows * \frac{height}{rows} = height $ 
 It seems to be the case that the number of columns and rows does not matter, as the distance traveled will always be the sum of the width (horizontal distance) and height (vertical distance). 
 We could divide the square infinitely, so we have infinite columns and infinite rows, and the distance will still be the same (20 units in this example). 
 Wait a minute... 
 My Conjectures 
 
 According to the above, the distance traveled through infinite segments will be 20. 
 
 Why is the value so different from the hypotenuse (almost 50% higher), given than the path from A to B would pretty much represent a diagonal line at that point? 
 
 
 It's been long since I studied integrals and Calculus, so I'm looking for someone that would not mind spending some time explaining this. 
 Thank you! 
 PS: I looked at  this question , which has a nice diagram similar to mine, but the  Manthatan Distance  (aka Taxicab Geometry) is not what I'm looking for, as it does not mention any relation with hypotenuse distance when the number of segments approaches infinity.

"A few weeks ago at school we started a course in linear algebra. A few days ago we got a problem and some steps on how to solve the problem. I get this working just plugging in numbers, but I don't understand why this actually works. The problem is described below: 
 find the intersection x y coordinates of the following equations: 
 $$
\begin{bmatrix}x\\y \\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}6\\-\frac{8}{3} \\ \end{bmatrix} + \lambda\begin{bmatrix}12\\-6 \\ \end{bmatrix} \\ \begin{bmatrix}11\\ 2\\ \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\y \\ \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}11\\2 \\ \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}5\\-\frac{47}{2}\\ \end{bmatrix}
$$ 
 We were taught to set up the equation of a perpendicular line of the first equation, then calculating some constant $c$ :
$$
-6x-12y=c \\ -6*6-12*-\frac{8}{3} = c \\ c=-4
$$ 
 Then for the second equation, we get the following:
$$
11x+2y=11*5+2*-\frac{47}{2}\\
11x+2y=8
$$
Next, we solve the following system:
$$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
-6x-12y=-4 \\
12x+2y = 8
\end{array}
\right. 
$$ 
 Which gives the answer $x = \frac{11}{15}$ and $y = \frac{-1}{30}$ 
 What I don't understand: 
 
 Why do we need to calculate perpendicular line equation to find the point where these two lines intersect? Why can't we just use or modify the original equation? 
 What does that constant $c$ represent and why do we need it?

 It all sounds like I need to solve some recursive relations. Let $h(k)$ be the expected number of steps / years in this example until we reach the state $0$ when you are in state $2$. So we have that 
$$h(2)=0$$ 
 because when you are in state $2$, you need $0$ steps / years to reach $2$. Then for $k=1$ 
 $$h(1) = 1+0.25h(1)+0.25h(2)+0.5h(0)$$ 
 because when you are in state $1$ you will need a step ($+1$) so you will reach with probability $0.25$ state $1$ again and with probability $0.25$ state $2$ and with probability $0.5$ state $0$. 
 Similarly we do this for $h(0):$ 
 $$h(0) = 1+1h(0)$$

 Scenario : Stay at first choice and Stay at second choice. (Stay1, Stay2)

 $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{4}$ 
 The probability of winning by staying is equal to the probability of choosing the car at first,  $\frac{1}{n}$ , and in this case  $\frac{1}{4}$ .  
 Scenario : Stay1 & Switch2  
 If you have a switch move included in the strategy then the first pick must not be the car as it will be impossible to win. So the first pick must be a goat hence  $\frac{3}{4}$ . 
 $\frac{3}{4} \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = \frac{3}{4}$ 
 There is a  $1$  probability of staying as the contestant must stay with the goat even though Monty reveals one if the next move is to switch. 
 Scenario : Switch1 & Stay2
If the contestant’s strategy includes switching as a first step and staying as second then the right pick must not be the first.   
 $\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot  1 = \frac{3}{8}$   
 Scenario : Switch1 & Switch2

"I managed to show with de L'Hospital that $$\lim_{x \to 0+}  \sqrt[x]{x} = 0.$$ 
 I calculated the first two derivatives and realised that it is getting more and more complicated due to the product rule and powers of logarithms to show that the limit 
$$\lim_{x \to 0+} \frac{d^k}{dx^k} \sqrt[x]{x} = 0$$ 
 which some plots that I made are indicating.  
 I also thought about using 
$$\lim_{x \to 0+}  \exp\left(-{\frac{1}{x}}\right)^{\ln(x)}$$
because inductively the limits of $\exp\left(- \frac{1}{x} \right)$ are a lot easier to calculate, though I didn't come up with a general formula and don't know how to use it properly with the given problem above.  
 A result that might be helpful, that I could proof, was that for all $\alpha >0$ it follows that
$$ \lim_{x \to 0+}  x^{\alpha} \, \ln(x) = 0.$$ 
 Could you offer me any hints how to get to the desired result by induction? Is there an easy way to exchange the limit with the derivative? 
 Ideas so far: Let's restrict ourself to the compact intervall $[0,1]$. $f$ being a realvalued continous and bounded function defined on $(0,1]$ is uniform continous iff $f$ is can be continously extended on $[0,1]$. As this is valid for $k=0$, we exchange the first derivative with the limit and get that $\lim_{x \to 0+} (x^{\frac{1}{x}}) ' = 0$. As $(x^{\frac{1}{x}}) '$ is bounded, we can repeat the argument inductively. 
 The first two derivates are: 
 $$(x^{\frac{1}{x}}) ' = \exp \left( \tfrac{\ln(x)}{x} \right)\,\left( \frac{1-\ln(x)}{x^2} \right) = \sqrt[x]{x}\,\left( \frac{1-\ln(x)}{x^2} \right)$$

"NovaDenizen says the polynomial sequence i wanted to know about has these two recurrence relations

 (2) $p_{n+1}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{x} ip_n(i)$ 
 == 
 i was trying to calculate the probability of something and i came upon them. i needed to know what this was equal to: 
 $$p_n(x)=\sum_{k_n=k_{n-1}}^{x}....\sum_{k_3=k_2}^{x} \sum_{k_2=k_1}^{x} \sum_{k_1=1}^{x}k_1k_2...k_n$$ 
 $k \in (1,2,...,x)$. 
 if you make it continuous and over the reals instead of over the natural numbers then its not too hard to see what that equals. 
 $$p_n(x) \approx \int_{k_n=0}^{x}...\int_{k_3=k_2}^{x}\int_{k_2=k_1}^{x}k_1k_2k_ndk_1dk_2...dk_n =\dfrac{(x)^{2n}}{2^n n!}$$ 
 i computed some of these and got  
 $$p_1(x) \approx \frac{x^2}{2}, p_2(x) \approx \frac{x^4}{8}, p_3(x) \approx \frac{x^6}{48}, p_4(x) \approx \frac{x^8}{384}, p_5(x) \approx \frac{x^{10}}{3840},...$$
so im assuming that's the formula.  
 from the summation formula its easy to see that $$p_1(x)=\sum_{k=1}^x k=\frac{x(x+1)}{2}$$ 
 i spent some time to compute $$p_2(x)=\sum_{k_2=k_1}^x\sum_{k_1=1}^x k_1k_2=x^4/8+(5 x^3)/12+(3 x^2)/8+x/12=x (3 x+1) (x+1) (x+2)/24$$ 
 these agree with the approximations from integrating, which im guessing gives the first terms of $p_n(x)$. 
 also i think its might be fair to say that $\dfrac{(x)^{2n}}{2^n n!} < p_n(x) < \dfrac{(x+1)^{2n}}{2^n n!}$ if you can use the integral approximation to get lower and upper estimates of $p_n(x)$.

 The problem, as I see it, asks me to prove that the number of divisors for a number that is a power of a natural number - is odd.  
 What I tried: 
 I think to prove it using induction. Not sure I'm doing it the right way.  
 For  $n = 1:$  1 has only one divisor – itself, and it's the power of itself so its a power of a natural number, so it holds. 
 For  $n = n^2$ , take  $n^2$ , it's surely a power of natural number ( $n$ ). Aassume it holds.  
 Now prove for  $n = (n+1)^2$  again, it's surely a power of a natural number – (n+1). Let's calculate:  
 $$
(n+1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1
$$ 
 From the assumption we know that the number of divisors of  $n^2$  is odd, from the base – the number of divisors of  $1$  is odd and now we remain with  $2n$ ... not sure what to say on him.

 It can be geometrical. It can use arguments based on loose bounds of certain log values. It doesn't even have to be particularly simple as long as it is something you can do in your head and it is something you can explain reasonably clearly so that others can do also it (so if you're able to mentally calculate numbers like Euler, it's not useful for me). 
 You can safely assume that I have difficulties multiplying anything greater two single digit integers in my head. But I do also know that $$\limsup_{k\rightarrow \infty} \log(k) - a\cdot k < 0$$ for any $a>0$ without having to go back to a textbook.

"From Finan's Probability Book 6.22 
 George and Paul play a betting game. Each chooses an integer from 1 to
20 (inclusive) at random. If the two numbers differ by more than 3, George
wins the bet. Otherwise, Paul wins the bet. Calculate the probability that
Paul wins the bet. 
 As far as I understand, the total number of combinations is given by $_{r+n-1}C_r$ which in this case, is $210$. 
 I calculated all the numbers that differ by no more than $3$ manually, reasoning thus, that $1$ has $4$ ""partners"" that differ by no more than $3$, and they are $1, 2, 3, $ and $ 4$. 
 $2$ also has only $4$ partners that differ by no more than $3$ because I already counted $(1,2)$ 
 I continued for the first $17$ integers with each number having $4$ partners that differ by no more than $3$. 
 $18$ has only $3$ partners that were not already counted, they are $18, 19$ and $20$. 
 $19$ has $2$.  
 $20$ has $1$. 
 So in summary, all of the integers that differ by no more than $3$ from their partners are $17\cdot4 +3 +2 +1 =74$ 
 and ${74 \over 210} = 0.3523$

"I'm trying to understand probability calculations of getting basic patterns on random pixel generators. There is some background information for my questions, so thanks in advance for reading. 
 Below is the background for my questions: 
 Let's say we have random pixel generator with a square screen which has   $10 \times 10$  resolution (100 pixels in total, each pixel can have 3 colors) 
 In order to calculate the probability of having at least one  $2 \times 2$  same color square block  on that screen, I'm applying the following calculation based on complement probability:  
 $1-(26/27)^{81}=95\%$  approximately. 
(There are 81 different   $2 \times 2$  blocks on  $10 \times 10$  grid. Odds of having there are at least two different colors in   $2 \times 2$  square block is  $26/27$ ) 
 I was told that all computer modeling/simulations calculate the probability of having at least one   $2 \times 2$  same color block as approximately 93%, a little less than what I calculated with my basic approach.   
 On this  $10 \times 10$  square screen while center pixels can be part of 4 different square blocks, corner pixels each can be only part of 1 square block and pixels on the edges can be part of 2 different squares.  I thought this is the reason why I ended up with higher probability.   
 However, I was informed that I behaved each   $2 \times 2$  square blocks independently, therefore, I disregarded intersection of   $2 \times 2$  multicolor blocks that create   $2 \times 2$  same color square blocks. Therefore rather than positions of the pixel I indicate above, the fact that I behaved each   $2 \times 2$  independently did give incorrect probability.  
 My Questions 
 I was also told by someone else that if my  $10 \times 10$  grid was the plane of a torus (doughnut shape) or Klein bottle (Mobius strip) first column would be next to the tenth column & first row would be next to the tenth row which allows all   $2 \times 2$  pixels can be part of 4 squares, therefore my basic calculation would work. 
 -Is this logic correct?  Is there a flaw in my calculation related to the shape of the screen or is it related to independence of events?  Because no matter which shape the screen is   $2 \times 2$  square blocks will be always intersecting because they are dependent. 
 - Is there a mathematical formula that allows us to calculate this probability on different planes? Are computer simulations adjustable based on different planes?

 Rationale behind requested formula 
 When  reviewing code  implementing a  minion game , the problem of how many substrings exists within a long text, and how many characters will the sum of all these substrings be came up. I found that the number of substrings is: 
 $$
n + n-1 + n-2 + ... + 2 + 1 = \frac{(n+1)\cdot n}{2}
$$ 
 Reasoning for finding number of substrings is that you have $n$ substrings of length $1$, $n-1$ of length $2$, and so on until the end where you only have $1$ substring of length $n$. 
 Using the same logic, to sum up the length of all these substrings, we arrive at the formula at the top, which I would like to have simplified.
That is, multiply the count of substrings with the length of the substring, and sum all these. 
 I have found the article "" The Kth Sum of N Numbers "", which seems to produce the number I want in the column for  c3 , with the $n$ enumerated as $rN$. But I can't read out of this article how the column is calculated, and what formula to use.

"Let $E(n)$ be the set of all possible  ending arrangements  of a race of $n$  competitors . 
 Obviously, because it's a race, each one of the $n$ competitors wants to win.
Hence, the order of the arrangements  does  matter.
Let us also say that if two competitors end with the same result of time, they win the same spot. 
 For example, $E(3)$ contains the following sets of arrangements: 
 ${(1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,1), (2,1,2),(2,1,3), (2,2,1), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), (3,2,1)}.$ 
 Needless to say, for example, that the arrangement $(1,3,3)$ is invalid, because the two competitors that  supposedly  ended in the third place,  actually  ended in the second place. So the above arrangement  ""transfers""  to $(1,2,2)$. 
 Define $k$ to be the number of  distinct   positions  of the competitors in a subset of $E(n)$. 
We have for example: 
 $(1,1,1)\Rightarrow k = 1$ 
 $(1,2,1)\Rightarrow k = 2$ 
 $(1,2,3,2)\Rightarrow k = 3$ 
 $(1,2,1,5,4,4,3)\Rightarrow k = 5$ 
 Finally , let $M(n,k)$ be the  number of subsets  of $E(n)$ in which the competitors ended in  exactly  $k$ distinct positions. 
 We get, for example, $M(3,3) = M(3,2) = 6$ and $M(3,1) = 1$. 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Thus far is the question 
 It's a problem I came up with solely by myself. After some time of thought I came up with the following recursive formula for $|E(n)|$: 
 (Don't continue reading if you want to derive a formula yourself!) 
 $$|E(n)| = \sum_{l=1}^n\binom{n}{l}\cdot |E(n-l)| \quad\text{where}\quad |E(0)| = 1$$ 
 The logic behind this recurrence relation is that $l$ symbolizes how many ""first"" spots we have. For each $l$, the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{l}$ symbolizes in how many ways we can pick $l$ first-placers out of the $n$ competitors. Once we have chosen them, we to need to figure out in how many ways we can arrange the $n-l$ competitors we have left, which is just $|E(n-l)|$.
I get the following: 
 $|E(3)| = 13$ 
 $|E(5)| = 541$ 
 $|E(10)| = 102247563$ 
 $|E(100)|$ mod $1$ $000$ $000$ $007 = 619182829$ $\rightarrow$ 20 ms. 
 And $|E(1000)|$ mod $1$ $000$ $000$ $007 = 581423957$ $\rightarrow$ 39 sec. 
 I figured out that $|E(n)|$ can also be visualized as the number of sets to which the following applies: 
 For every $i = 1, 2, 3 ... n$, every $i$-tuple subset of the original set has GCD (greatest common divisor) of all of its elements equal to 1.
But I'm not 100% sure about this because I was not able to compute this approach for large $n$.
However, even with precalculating factorials and memoizing the $E(n)$'s, the calculating times for higher $n$'s grow very fast.
Is anyone capable of verifying the above formula and values?
Can anyone derive a better, faster formula? Perhaps with generating functions? 
 As for $M(n,k)$.. I'm totally clueless. I absolutely have no idea how to calculate it, and therefore I couldn't post any meaningful data points. 
Perhaps it's $P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.
Can anyone figure out a formula for $M(n,k)$?  
 I have no idea which function is harder to compute, either $E(n)$ or $M(n,k)$, but helping me with either of them will be very much appreciable. 
 I want the solutions to be generic as well as work efficiently even for large $n$'s. Exhaustive search is not what I'm looking for, unfortunately. 
What I am looking for is solutions based purely on combinatorial approach and efficient formulas.

 My approach to calculate  $f_{Z|S}(z|1)$  would be to consider that, if I know that  $S=1$  therefore  $Z = X$  and  $f_{Z|S}(z|1) = f_{X|S}(x|1)$ . What I don't understand is how to come out with the marginal of  $Z$ . The marginal of  $X$  is: 
 
 $p \cdot \alpha e^{-\alpha x}$  when  $x \geq 0$

 Question:  I want to verify that my next attempt is correct, I do it too exhausted and in that state I do not trust my abilities. 
 My attempt:  Note that $$\sum_{k=1}^{n}\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{2n+1}\right)=\mathbb{Re}\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n}e^{\frac{2\pi k i}{2n+1}}\right).$$
In this sense, we know that
$$\begin{array}{rcl}\sum_{k=1}^{n}e^{\frac{2\pi k i}{2n+1}}&=&{\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{n}\left(e^{\frac{2\pi  i}{2n+1}}\right)^{k} } \\ &=& {\displaystyle\frac{e^{\frac{2\pi  i}{2n+1}}-\left(e^{\frac{2\pi  i}{2n+1}}\right)^{n+1}}{1-e^{\frac{2\pi  i}{2n+1}}} } \\
&=& {\displaystyle\frac{ \left(e^{\frac{2\pi  i}{2n+1}}-e^{\frac{2(n+1)\pi  i}{2n+1}}\right)\left( 1-e^{\frac{-2\pi  i}{2n+1}} \right)  }{\left(1-e^{\frac{2\pi  i}{2n+1}}\right)\left(1-e^{\frac{-2\pi  i}{2n+1}}\right) } } \\
&=& {\displaystyle\frac{e^{\frac{2\pi  }{2n+1}}-e^{\frac{2\pi (n+1)  }{2n+1}} -1 +e^{\frac{2\pi n }{2n+1}}  }{2-\cos\left( \frac{2\pi  }{2n+1} \right)} } 
\end{array}$$ 
 Therefore, we have
$${\mathbb{Re}\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n}e^{\frac{2\pi k i}{2n+1}}\right)=\displaystyle\frac{\cos\left(\frac{2\pi  }{2n+1}\right)-\cos\left(\frac{2\pi (n+1)  }{2n+1}\right) -1 +\cos\left(\frac{2\pi n }{2n+1}\right)   }{2-\cos\left( \frac{2\pi  }{2n+1} \right)} }.  $$
Hence, we can conclude
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{2n+1}\right)=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\mathbb{Re}\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n}e^{\frac{2\pi k i}{2n+1}}\right)=\displaystyle\frac{\cos\left(0\right)-\cos\left(\pi\right) -1 +\cos\left(0\right)   }{2-\cos\left( 0 \right)}=0 .$$

"Background: 
 ( Skip if you're familiar ) 
 The Golden Ratio is calculated by assuming that a line segment is divided in to two subsegments so that the ratio between the entire segment and the larger subsegment is the same as the ratio between the larger subsegment and the smaller. So, if the entire line segment is defined to be unit length, with the larger subsegment length  $a$ , and the smaller length  $b$  the Golden Ratio can be calculate by solving this system of equations: 
 $$ a^2 - b = 0  $$ 
 $$ a + b = 1 $$ 
 in which the  $b$ s cancel, and (assuming  $a>0$ ) we are left with: 
 $$ a^2 + a - 1 = 0 \implies \boxed{a = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}} \implies \boxed{b =\frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}} $$ 
 $$ \boxed{\phi = \frac{a}{b} = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{3-\sqrt{5}} \approx 1.618...} $$ 
 
 Question: 
 I'm interested in what happens when the segment is divided in to larger number of subsegments. For instance, if the segment is divided in to three subsegments ( $a$ , the largest,  $b$  the second largest, and  $c$  the smallest), if we assume the ratio between the entire segment and  $a$  is the same as the ratio between  $a$  and  $b$ , which is the same as the ratio between  $b$  and  $c$ , the problem comes down to solving a system of  three  equations: 
 $$ a^3 - c = 0 $$ 
 $$ a^2 - b = 0 $$ 
 $$ a + b + c = 1, $$ 
 which reduces to: 
 $$ a^3 + a^2 + a - 1 = 0. $$ 
 My questions are these : 
 
 Is there a clever way to solve the above system of equations for a closed-form solution? Wolfram Alpha can give me the numerical approximation, but seems to struggle with finding the closed-form. 
 
 One is tempted to think that this pattern will continue -- i.e. that for a line segment subdivided in to  $n$  subsegments, the ratio will be determined by finding the roots of the polynomial: $$ a^n + a^{n-1} + \cdots + a - 1 = 0. $$  Is there any non-messy way to prove this (perhaps by induction)? 
 
 If the answers are yes to (1) and (2),  is there a closed form solution to the Golden Ratio for  $n$  subsegments?

 So, for example, I know that doubling 7*P (66,47) gives me the point 14*P (54,19). 
 
 Is there a division operation which can take the point (54,19) and give me (66,47)?  If so, could I do it again to 7*P, and what would be the result? 3*P or 4*P? 
 
 In  this blog post  towards the top, she mentions the Multiplicative Inverse being used in the division operation.   
 I am using a C# Library ( found here ) to calculate the values above, and it also has an ""Extended Euclidean"" Function which when I plug in 14*P (54,19) spits out (6,-17). 
 
 Is (6,-17) the multiplicative inverse of (54,19), and if so how do I use it to get back to (66,47) 
 If this is possible, can the same rules be applied to very large sets for example NIST P-192 or the secp256k1?

 Calculate $$\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin^3{x}}{e^x-1}\,\mathrm dx.$$ 
 
 It seems that the integral cannot be solved in terms of elementary functions, so I try to use the Cauchy (residue) theorem to evaluate it. However, I couldn't find a complex function $$f(z) = \frac{?}{e^z-1}$$ to evaluate this real integral. If the numerator were $\sin{x}$, we can consider $e^{iz}$ since $$ \sin{z} = \frac{e^{iz}-e^{-iz}}{2i}.$$
Is there any hint or method to solve this problem?

 This polynomial can be written as an algebraic combination of these elementary symmetric polynomials: $\{u+s,us,v+t,vt\}$. 
 An easy example is: $u^2 + s^2 = (u+s)^2 - 2us$.  
 But if I have $s^n t+u^n v$ things get more complicated (even for $n=1$). 
 I need to compute this ""symmetric form"" of a bunch of polynomials, so I would like to know how can I do it with software.  
 I tried with Maple but it cannot handle  $u\leftrightarrow s$ AND $v\leftrightarrow t$ (at the same time).  
 In case it is relevant to the context, these polynomials are functions on the Jacobian $J$ of a hyperelliptic curve of genus $2$. So these are functions in the function field $k(J)$ where the generic point of $J$ is $\{(u,v),(s,t)\}$.

 I wasn't too sure about that and gave the example that if we have a temperature field  $\theta(t,x,y)$  defined over a two dimensional plane, equation (2) holds good but it doesn't mean anything till we define a trajectory through the plane parametrized by  $x \equiv x(t)$  and  $y \equiv y(t)$ . Then  $\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$  and  $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t}$  take finite values and you can calculate an analytical expression for  $\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t}$ . My colleague said my intuition was coming from particle mechanics (which he is right about) but for a field  $\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\partial\theta}{\partial t}$ . However, I still think that to say  $\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\partial\theta}{\partial t}$  is like defining a trajectory where you are standing at a fixed point ( $x$ , $y$ ) and evaluating  $\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t}$  there. In this case, I would agree with him. However, if  $x$  and  $y$  are independent of  $t$ ,  $\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}$  should be undefined and can't be zero because for a small change in  $t$ , the corresponding change in  $x$  could be anything since  $x$  and  $t$  are independent of each other.

"Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $f$, $g$  be smooth functions in some neibourhood of a point $x_0\in M$, $\nabla g\ne0$. 
 1) How to define $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}$ invariantly? If $M$ is a domaqin in $\mathbb R^n$ then the derivative in the direction of $\nabla g$ seems to give an answer: $\displaystyle \frac{(\nabla f,\nabla g)}{|\nabla g|^2}$. But to calculate $\nabla g$ and $|\nabla g|$ on a manifold one needs a metric. From the other hand, if we consider smooth  coordinates $(g_1=g, g_2,\ldots,g_n)$ in some neibourhood of $x_0$, then partial derivatives $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}$ seem to be defined in the standard way. But the question arises, would the value $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}$ be independent from the choice of $ g_2,\ldots,g_n$? If no, what are the correct way do do it? Is there some reference?

 Addition of may 27 
 Suppose that now there is a riemannian metric on $M$. Then what would be most natural definition of partial derivative  $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}$? For expample, to take $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}=df(\nabla g)=(df,*dg)$ seems not right since that would mean  $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}=\displaystyle \frac{\partial g}{\partial f}$. If we take $\displaystyle \frac{(\nabla f,\nabla g)}{|\nabla g|}$ it would be sort of directional derivative. So the right question seems to me here is what value of $a$ it is best to take for $\displaystyle \frac{(\nabla f,\nabla g)}{|\nabla g|^a}$ to be a partial derivative? Or is there no the ""best"" choice?  I tried to apply to dimensional analysis and it seems $a=1$ is the choice to have the result be like $\nabla f$ but I'm not sure because may be one have to assign some dimension to metric.

"I'm working on a tiled 2D game, and trying to implement a more complicated version of a fairly standard line-of-sight algorithm.  When checking for occlusions, I need to be able to take neighbouring cells into account, but exactly which neighbours (and which of their edges) are important will depend on which octant the line-of-sight vector is in. 
 I feel like, if I can reflect the original vector into the ENE octant (+x, +y, θ <= 45°), perform my calculations, and then perform the inverse reflection to get back to the original coordinate space, then that would make things quite easy (i.e. I wouldn't need 8 distinct implementations). 
 The information I've been able to find so far about performing reflections mostly assumes I have a known reflection (e.g. ""over the x axis"", ""over the y=mx axis""), and that I'm trying to calculate the result of applying that reflection.  But I'm trying to do the inverse: I know where I want the vector to land, I'm trying to find a reflection that will put it there (and its inverse, to put it back after). 
 As a programmer, getting the arbitary vector v  into  the desired octant is easy: 
 new.x = abs(v.x)
new.y = abs(v.y)
if (new.y > new.x) swap(new.x, new.y)
 
 but that leaves me no crumb to find my way back to the original coordinate space. 
 Intuitively, it seems like I might be able to build my reflection matrix using combinations of  sign(v.x) ,  sign(v.y) ,  abs(v.x) ,  abs(v.y) , etc?  But I would just be taking shots in the dark, and if I got the result I wanted, I couldn't say for certain whether it was correct, or just a one-time coincidence.  I kinda know what a reflection matrix looks like, but I don't understand how to construct one. 
 Background: I'm not fluent in mathematical notation or terminology, and I have no formal education in linear algebra.  I understand the basic operations, in an ""occasional dabbler that learned from the internet and has to look it up and learn it all again each time"" capacity, but not well enough to recognise which operations might be useful here. 
 Further background: my  real  input is two points (A and B), and I'm glossing over V=B-A to translate to the origin, and then the inverse again after, because I understand that aspect. 
 Edit: It seems like there's only 8 possible reflection axes I would need to consider (including the case where it's already in the desired octant), so I guess I could take a brute force approach of just looping over those and trying them in turn, until I find the one that puts the input vector into the desired octant.  But I wouldn't learn anything from doing that... 
 Edit 2: I already have other code that uses a similar octant-based divide-and-conquer strategy, which means I can already reflect easily from the ENE octant back into real grid coords  iff  I have a matrix representing that reflection to use -- which is why I'm thinking about how to represent this as a matrix.  The existing code is used by my player-field-of-view calculation, which loops over all 8 octants, so its reflection matrices are already known -- which is why I have reflection matrices already, yet don't know how to derive one arbitrarily :) 
 Edit 3: I've been experimenting with the ""householder transformation"" to turn a reflection axis (l = v + v') into a reflection matrix: 
 $$
A = \frac{1}{\lVert \vec{l} \rVert ^2}
\begin{bmatrix}
l_x^2 - l_y^2 & 2l_xl_y \\
2l_xl_y & l_y^2 - l_x^2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 
 This works well (i.e. produces reflection matrices that look like what I expect) for 4 of the 8 octants. Three of the others end up non-diagonal, with fractional values; the fourth, where v and v' are directly opposite each other and thus their resultant is (0, 0), is all NaNs. 
 I'm about to try a different strategy, using the 3 bits of information that @indnwkybrd observes as a lookup into the 8-slot array of precalculated reflection matrices that I already had anyway...

"$$\sum_{j=0}^{n}a_{3n-j}=\sum_{j=2n}^{3n}a_{j}$$
I know this is true because you can calculate some terms and are the exact same terms written in the reverse order. 
 But if you substitute $t=3n-j$, you get:
$$\sum_{t=3n}^{2n}a_{t}=\sum_{j=2n}^{3n}a_{j}$$
$$\sum_{j=3n}^{2n}a_{j}=\sum_{j=2n}^{3n}a_{j}$$ 
 Now I would say it is still true, but I'm not sure, because if it was an integral (instead of a sum) there would be a minus!  
 I mean, is $\sum_{j=3n}^{2n}a_{j}$ equal to $\sum_{j=2n}^{3n}a_{j}$ or equal to $-\sum_{j=2n}^{3n}a_{j}$?

"Hello guys/girls I was bored and I just played around with math. I am stuck and it's about raised numbers. (9, 6 and 3) 
 So this is how you calculate it. (same method for all numbers) 
 
 Raise 3, 6 and 9 each from 1 to 10. 
 If the product is more than one digit then add up the digits until there is only one digit. 
 Look at the result... 
 
 Number 3. 
 3^1 = 3 
 3^2 =  9 
 3^3 = 27 = 2+7 =  9 
 3^4 = 81 = 8+1 =  9 
 3^5 = 243 = 2+4+3 =  9 
 3^6 = 729 = 7+2+9 = 18 = 1+8 =  9 
 3^7 = 2187 = 2+1+8+7 = 18 = 1+8 =  9 
 3^8 = 6561 = 6+5+6+1 = 18 = 1+8 =  9 
 3^9 = 19683 = 1+9+6+8+3 = 27 = 2+7 =  9 
 3^10 = 59049 = 5+9+0+4+9 = 27 = 2+7 =  9* 
 Number 6. 
I'm not gonna write plus signs now, because I think you've got the Idea 
 6^1 = 6 
 6^2 = 36 =  9 
 6^3 = 216 =  9 
 6^4 = 1296 = 18 =  9 
 6^5 = 7776 = 27 =  9 
 6^6 = 46656 = 27 =  9 
 6^7 = 279936 = 36 =  9 
 6^8 = 1679616 = 36 =  9 
 6^9 = 10077696 = 36 =  9 
 6^10 = 60466176 = 36 =  9 
 Number 9. 
 9^1 =  9 
 9^2 = 81 =  9 
 9^3 = 729 = 18 =  9 
 9^4 = 6561 = 18 =  9 
 9^5 = 59049 = 27 =  9 
 9^6 = 531441 = 18 =  9 
 9^7 = 4782969 = 45 =  9 
 9^8 = 43046721 = 27 =  9 
 9^9 = 387420489 = 45 =  9 
 9^10 = 3486784401 = 45 =  9 
 So to my question, why is the sum 9 for number 3 and 6 and not only for the 9 itself? 
I know that 3, 6 and 9 is relative to each other but i'm still confused. (3+6+9 = 18 = 1+8 = 9) 
 And is there an equation for this?

 The answer is $0$. The book says that this line lives within the plane.

 I have managed to confirm that the plane is parallel with the line. You just get the normal vector $(31,3,18)$ and then calculate its dot product with $(-3,1,5)$. This yields $0$, so the plane is parallel to the line indeed. Given this fact, there are two scenarios: either the line lives within the plane, or it doesn't. If it did, then the point $(2,1,1)$ should be in the plane! I think...

 Find the rank and the four eigenvalues of the following matrix:

 Answer: 
 
 The matrix has rank 2 (ensuring two zero eigenvalues) and $(1,1,1,1)$ is an
  eigenvector with  $\lambda=2$. With trace 4, the other eigenvalue is
  also $\lambda=2$, and it's eigenvector is $(1,-1,1,-1)$. 
 
 This is directly taken from my book. The answer does not give a clear answer as to what the four eigenvalues are. 
 
 Is the answer $0,0,2,2$(the four eigenvalues)? 
 I see that the rank is $2$ and the trace is $4$. $n-r=2$, meaning that two of the eigenvalues are $0$. The determinant is $0$. I know that the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, so the sum in this case is 4. How does one calculate the two eigenvalues?

"There are $7$ boys and $3$ girls who need to be lined up in a row. Find the number of ways so that each boy is adjacent to at most one girl. 
 In simple terms the situation demands that any distribution of the type $$...GBG...$$ must not come into play. 
 First of all the total number of arrangements are $10!$ and we can actually find a complement of those situations which we don't want. 
 In order to calculate the number of ways in which the wrong position can be true, I considered $GBG$ to be kind of a single package.
The number of ways to make this package are:$${7 \choose 1} \cdot {3 \choose 2} \cdot 2!$$, now considering this package and $6$ boys plus the $1$ girl left,
we can permute them all in 8! ways [$6$ boys, $1$ girl and our ""package""], thus making the total to be 
$$ {7 \choose 1} \cdot {3 \choose 2} \cdot 2! \cdot 8! \tag{1}$$ 
 Things seem to be tractable hithero, but as I was writing this questions I saw one problem in my argument: The cases containing the configurations $GBGBG$ have been possible counted several times thus $(1)$ is not giving the correct number of ways to be subtracted.

All other cells are symmetric (cells below the diagonal being 0 obviously). I recognize cell 1-1 is 2^k and hope the others are not too complicated, but this might be a gamble under time pressure.

"Scenario 
 We are given a single six-sided die. We produce a sequence of $n$ dice rolls, all of them rolling six. We do not know whether the die is fair or not. 
 How can we calculate the probability that the die is loaded or rigged given $n$ rolls of six? 
 In other words, what is the probability $q$ that the null hypothesis is false, given a series of $n$ successful Bernoulli trials? 
 Common fallacy 
 I heard a non-mathematician say that the probability of one six on a fair die is $\frac{1}{6}$, and so the probability of rolling 4 sixes in a row on a fair die is $\frac{1}{6^4} = \frac{1}{1296}$. So far, so good. 
 But then, he said that the probability that the die is not loaded is $\frac{1}{1296}$, and so the probability that the die is loaded is $\frac{1295}{1296}$. 
 This does not add up to me. By the same logic, if I roll the die once and get six, the probability that the die is loaded is $\frac{5}{6}$, which cannot be true. You don't call a person a cheat for rolling a six once. 
 My attempt to answer 
 I think that to answer this question, I have to use the binomial distribution somehow, since: 
 
 the probability of a six, fair or not, remains constant and equal to $p$ 
 I am only interested in success/failure 
 
 At this point, I get lost. The problem is that I only know the probability for the null hypothesis $p_0 = \frac16$, and I don't know what the actual value for $p$ is. I don't know where to go from here. 
 Am I asking the wrong question? Must I set a confidence level $\alpha$? If so, suppose I set $\alpha = 0.05$? $\alpha = 0.01$? I apologize for any incorrect terminology. I am a computer programmer, not a statistician or mathematician. 
 Edit:  It looks like I have to specify how badly the dice must be loaded before I call them unfair. Suppose I say rolling a six has to be at least $r = 10\%$ more likely than a fair die (i.e. $p \ge p_0\cdot\left(1 + r\right) = \frac{11}{60}$) before I call it rigged?

"I am trying to use Newtons algorithm for polynomial interpolation. The original polynomial is  $p(x) = 3x^2+4x+7$  and the Points from which I am trying to interpolate the polynomial are  $p(1) = 14$ ,  $p(6) = 139$  and  $p(7) = 182$ . 
 Now as far as I know the formula for the interpolated polynomial should be  $r(x) = a_0+a_1(x-x_0)+a_2(x-x_0)(x-x_1)$ . 
 To find  $a_0$  I calculate  $y_0 = 14 = a_0$ .
Then,  $y_1 = 139 = a_0 + a_1 (x_1-x_0)=14+a_1(6-1)$  so by solving for  $a_1$  the result is  $a_1 = 25$ .
At last,  $y_2 = 182 = a_0 + a_1(x_1-x_0)+a_2(x_2-x_0)(x_2-x_1)=14+25(6-1)+a_2(7-1)(7-6)$  and solving for  $a_2$  results in  $a_2=\frac{43}{6}$ . 
 By inserting the found values into the formula I get  $r(x)=14+25(x-1)+\frac{43}{6}(x-1)(x-6)=\frac{43}{6}x^2-\frac{151}{6}x+32$ .  
 This polynomial doesn't go though the last point though:  $r(7)=\frac{43}{6}\cdot49-\frac{151}{6}\cdot7+32=207 \ne  182=p(7)$ .

"1. THE PROBLEM 
 Take the definition of the derivative: 
 $$\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$ 
 Using this definition to calculate the derivative of  $e^x$  is not the most trivial thing to do, as one ends up with: 
 $$\frac{d}{dx}e^x=e^x\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{e^h-1}{h}$$ 
 We can finish this off by a change of variables  $n=\frac1h$ . 
 $$e^x\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{e^h-1}{h}=e^x\lim_{n\to\infty}n(e^{1/n}-1)=e^x\cdot\ln e=e^x$$ 
 Note:  the second to last equality holds because of a limit definition of the natural logarithm:  $\ln x=\lim_{n\to\infty}n(x^{1/n}-1)$ . 
 As we see, calculating the derivative of the exponential function is not easy with the usual limit definition of the derivative. It requires calculating a limit that is not obvious without knowing a special limit definition of  $\ln x$ . 
 One can wonder then, are there easier ways of proving that  $\frac{d}{dx}e^x=e^x$ ? Indeed, there are easier ways to  prove  this. But all of the proofs I have ever seen either assume a taylor series or limit definition of the exponential function, or somehow use the derivative of  $\ln x$  which itself has similar calculation problems. Finally, the proofs lack deep motivated intuition, and are raw algebraic manipulations for the most part. They  prove  things well, but they don't  explain  things well. 
 Question:  is there a way to find the derivative of the exponential function intuitively? 
 
 2. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS 
 I didn't ask this question without giving it a little thought. 
 Path A 
 I figured that one solution to this problem might be by intuituvely explaining how in the world  $\ln x$  is equal to  $\lim_{n\to\infty}n(x^{1/n}-1)$ . 
 Euler observed, quite unrigorously, that if  $\epsilon$  is an arbitrarily small number, then: 
 $$\ln(1+\epsilon)=\epsilon$$ 
 Similarly, if we let  $n$  be an arbitrarily  large  number, we can observe that: 
 $$x^{1/n}-1=\epsilon$$ 
 Plugging this observation into the first one, we have: 
 $$\ln(x^{1/n})=x^{1/n}-1$$ 
 $$\frac1n\ln x=x^{1/n}-1$$ 
 $$\ln x=n(x^{1/n}-1)$$ 
 Thus: 
 $$\ln x=\lim_{n\to\infty}n(x^{1/n}-1)$$ 
 This would almost work as a solution,  except  for the fact that here we make observations that work for logarithms of  all  bases. The observation  $\log_b(1+\epsilon)=\epsilon$  is valid for all bases  $b$ . The second observation we made doesn't even relate specifically to logarithms. Thus, the ""intuition"" in this case assumes that the limit can be equal to a logarithm of any base. This is obviously false; computations evidently show that this limit holds  only  for  $b=e$ . And it is not evident at all why it has to be  $e$  and nothing else. 
 This solution will be complete if it can be shown why base  $e$  and none other work. 
 Path B 
 Another solution to this problem would be noting that the exponential function grows proportionally to its size. The problem with this intuition is that it is not at all evident why would this function follow such a behavior. 
 The mystery is, how does one start with simple algebraic properties of exponents, which are trivially defined by multiplication, and arrive the conclusion that this function follows its unique growth behavior. It might help to note that exponentiation turns an arithmetic sequence into a geometric sequence. 
 Id est , if: 
 $$\alpha_n=a+\sum^n_1 d$$ 
 $$\gamma_n=b\prod^n_1 r$$ 
 Then: 
 $$e^{\alpha_n}=e^{a+\sum^n_1 d}=e^a\prod^n_1 e^d=b\prod^n_1 r=\gamma_n$$ 
 If there is a way to start with basic algebraic facts about exponents and end up (intuitively) with the fact that exponential growth is proportional to its size, we could then justify the fact that  $e^x$  is the solution of  $y'=y$ ,  $y(0)=1$ . From there, we could automatically say that the derivative of the natural exponential is itself. 
 Caveat:  While solving this ODE, there is still a problem because we need to compute the integral of  $\frac1x$ . It turns out that we can intuitively solve this task. We can begin by splitting the area under the curve into n rectangles of  equal area   $A$ , situated between corresponding x coordinates:  $\{x_0, x_1, ..., x_n\}$ . We will then note that: 
 $$A=y_0(x_1-x_0)=y_1(x_2-x_1)$$ 
 $$\frac{x_1-x_0}{x_0}=\frac{x_2-x_1}{x_1}$$ 
 $$\frac{x_1}{x_0}-1=\frac{x_2}{x_1}-1$$ 
 $$\frac{x_1}{x_0}=\frac{x_2}{x_1}$$ 
 This will generalize to  $\frac{x_n}{x_{n-1}}=\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}$ . What this means is that, if rectangles are the same  area , if we increase the x coordinates geometrically (because the  ratio  between next and current x coordinate is constant), we increase the area arithmetically. This is precisely what logarithms do, they turn geometric sequences into arithmetic sequences (opposite of the exponentials). Thus, the integral of  $\frac1x$  will be some kind of logarithm. 
 The missing bit here, again, is...why is it base  e , and not some another base? 
 Other paths 
 Those two paths are most likely not the only approaches. 
 
 3. MOTIVATION 
 At this point, I overstressed the word ""intuition"", and I just wanted to explain myself. I just really love to explore things that are proven symbolically, in a natural way. I might be considered weird for trying to do that so deeply for such a simple derivative, but oh well. 
 Thank you in advance for any good insights into this problem.

"Let $f: S^n \to S^n$ be a continuous morphism between $n$-spheres. One knows (for example using Freudenthal's suspension thm) that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ holds $\pi_n(S^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}$.  
 Therefore we can define the degree $deg(f) \in \mathbb{Z}$ of $f$ in following unique way such the diagram below commutates: 
 $$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
\pi_n(S^n)  @>{f_*}  >> \pi_n(S^n)   \\
@VV \cong V  @VV \cong V   \\
\mathbb{Z} @>{\cdot deg(f)}>> \mathbb{Z} 
\end{CD}
$$ 
 Remark: the isomorphisms $\pi_n(S^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ are choosen compatible in the way that the fixed generator of $i_n \in \pi_n(S^n)$ is wlog in the left and right vertical maps is maped to $1$. 
 Therefore the map $\mathbb{Z}    \xrightarrow{\text{deg(f)}}  \mathbb{Z} $
is given as multiplication map $z \to deg(f) \cdot z$ 
 Consider from now on as $f_n$ the concatenation of canonical maps 
 $$f_n: S^n \xrightarrow{\text{p}} \mathbb{PR}^n \xrightarrow{\text{q}} \mathbb{PR}^n/\mathbb{PR}^{n-1} \cong S^n$$ 
 Here $p$ comes from double cover $S^n \to \mathbb{PR}^n$ and $q$ is the quotient arising from the CW / pushout structure of $\mathbb{PR}^n \cong \mathbb{PR}^{n-1} \cup_j D^n$  
 where $j: S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{PR}^{n-1}$ is the attatching map (the same as $p$ but for lower power $n-1$). 
 One can calculate using homology groups of $S^n$ and $\mathbb{PR}^n$ that  
 \begin{equation}
   deg(f_n) =
   \begin{cases}
     2 &  \text{if n odd} \\
     0 & \ \text{if n even} 
   \end{cases}
\end{equation} 
 My question is how one can visulize / understand intuitively that $deg(f_2) =0$ therefore that $f_2:S^2 \to S^2$ is null homotopic? 
 If we consider the case $f_1: S^1 \to S^1$ then one can intuitively relize that $deg(f_1) =2$ since by construction of $f_n$ and the identification $\mathbb{PR}^2 = S^1 /(x \sim -x)$ the map $f_1$ makes $S^1$ to run  two times  around itself.  
 But where is the the crux of the matter is why this argument fails for $f_2$? 
 Here I have drawn (please don't critizise my drawing talent :) ) the situation for  n=1: 
 
 But for $S^2$ it seems since $deg(f_2)=0$  that $f_2$ can be contracted to constant map. I suppose that this has do with the properties of boundary $S^1$ but I can’t really find an intuitive argument.  
 Can anybody help me to visualize the intuition behind this phenomena?

Examples of such covering for $n = 2$ and $n = 3$ cases (for simplicity I'm using there $n$-cube, but it could be any hyper-rectangle) are shown in the pictures below.  
 At the moment, it looks, that it would be possible to find all the distances between all rectangle vertices $ V(Rect) = \{ v_i: i=1,\dots,2^n \} $ and these two center points $C_1$ and $C_2$ and then to take:
$$
  R = \max_{v_i \in V(Rect)} \left\{ \min \left\{ \left\| v_i - C_1 \right\|, \left\| v_i - C_2 \right\| \right\} \right\},

"Let  $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ . Find the number b such that the average rate of change of  $f$  on the interval  $(2, b)$  is  $-\frac{1}{10}$ 
 Yesterday I attempted this question by calculating  $f(x_1)$  and  $f(x_2)$ : 
 $f(x_1)$  =  $\frac{2}{4}$  =  $\frac{1}{2}$ 
 $f(x_2)$  =  $\frac{1}{b}$ 
 Change is  $\frac{f(x_2)-f(x1)}{b - 2}$ 
 So: 
 $\frac{\frac{1}{b}-\frac{1}{2}}{b-2}$ 
 Yesterday I asked on here how to correctly subtract the fraction in the numerator . 
 I was able to get as far as rewriting the fraction in the numerator on my own as: 
 $\frac{\frac{2-b}{2b}}{b-2}$ 
 The solution in the question that I posted went further and managed to simplify this to  $-\frac{1}{2b}$ 
 I did not really understand how this was arrived at and I was hoping that someone could 'hold my hand' to understand how this was arrived that? That is my first question. 
 For the second part I was able to complete myself: Calculate  $b$  such that the rate of change on the interval  $(2,b)$  is  $-\frac{1}{10}$ : 
 $-\frac{1}{2b} = -\frac{1}{10}$ 
 $\frac{1}{2b} = \frac{1}{10}$  # multiply both sides by -1 
 $1 = \frac{2b}{10}$  # multiply out denominator on left side so multiply both sides by 2b 
 $10 = 2b$  # multiply out denominator on right side, multiply both sides by 10 
 $b = 5$  #tada 
 It is the in between step that I am confused about. I do not really follow how to go from this: 
 $\frac{\frac{2-b}{2b}}{b-2}$ 
 To this: 
 $-\frac{1}{2b}$

"I am reading Walker's book Codes and Curves and am having trouble proving this Lemma regarding the Asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov bound.  
 Suppose that  $q$  is a prime power and we define  \begin{align*}
V_q(n,r) &:= \sum\limits_{i=0}^r {n\choose r}(q-1)^i
\end{align*} 
 We define the Hilbert entropy function as  \begin{align*}
H_q(x) &:= \cases{0, & x= 0\\
x\log_q(q-1)-x\log_q x - (1-x)log_q(1-x), & $0 < x \leq 1-\frac{1}{q}$}
\end{align*} 
 There is a lemma that states if  $0\leq\lambda\leq 1-\frac{1}{q}$  then  \begin{align*}
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n} \log_q V_q(n,\lfloor \lambda n\rfloor) &= H_q(\lambda)
\end{align*} 
 Walker suggests using Stirling's approximation to get this limit. Here is what I have so far: First, I find that if  $0<\lambda \leq 1-\frac{1}{q}$  then  \begin{align*}
H_q(\lambda) &= \lambda\log_q(q-1)-\lambda\log_q \lambda - (1-\lambda)log_q(1-\lambda)\\
&= \log_q\left(\frac{(q-1)^\lambda}{\lambda^\lambda(1-\lambda)^{1-\lambda}}\right)
\end{align*} 
 Then, try to calculate  $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n}\log_q V_q(n,\lfloor \lambda n\rfloor)$ .
 \begin{align*}
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n}\log_q V_q(n,\lfloor \lambda n\rfloor) &= \lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \log_q\left(\left(\sum\limits_{i=0}^{\lfloor \lambda n\rfloor} {n\choose i}(q-1)^i\right)^\frac{1}{n}\right)\\
&= \log_q\left(\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \left(\sum\limits_{i=0}^{\lfloor \lambda n\rfloor} {n\choose i}(q-1)^i\right)^\frac{1}{n} \right)
\end{align*} 
 Looking only at the terms inside the logarithm, I would like to show that  \begin{align*}
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \left(\sum\limits_{i=0}^{\lfloor \lambda n\rfloor} {n\choose i}(q-1)^i\right)^\frac{1}{n}  &= \frac{(q-1)^\lambda}{\lambda^\lambda(1-\lambda)^{1-\lambda}}
\end{align*}   
 Unfortunately, I get stuck here.  This stackexchange post  pointed me to  this resource  which essentially shows the case for  $q=2$  in exercise 9.42. It looks easy to generalize to this problem using the provided method. However, I do not quite understand this crucial step:  
 If we let  $m = \lfloor\lambda n\rfloor$ , then we get that  \begin{align*}
{n\choose m}\sum\limits_{i=0}^m \left(\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\right)^i = {n\choose m}\frac{1-\alpha}{1-2\alpha}

 I am building a program to model the load that a user places on a server. The load a user produces follows a normal distribution. Depending on which application the user is using, however, the mean and variance of that normal distribution will be different. What I am trying to do is calculate the overall mean and variance for a user's activity given the proportions of time they use each application. 
 For example, Application A follows $\mathcal{N}(100, 50)$ and Application B follows $\mathcal{N}(500, 20)$.  If a user uses A 50% of the time and B the other 50%, what is the mean and variance of the data that the user would produce during a day? 
 I'm able to simulate this by selecting a number from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and then generating a value from the appropriate distribution.  Something like this: 
 $f(x) =
\begin{cases}
\mathcal{N}(100, 50), &0 \le x \lt 0.5\\
\mathcal{N}(500, 20), &0.5 \le x \lt 1\\

 There is a line drawn between each point to make the image - if you sketch the points above (I'd advise doing it programatically) you'll see a lower case 'a'. This is part of a project regarding online character recognition. I am currently investigating the effects of several pre-processing techniques that can be applied to such a recognition system, and one technique that many of the papers that I have read apply is to 'smooth' the image, usually via a Gaussian blur. Unfortunately, they all proclaim it as ""easy"", and therefore they neglect to mention  how  one goes about doing so. 
 I have been looking for quite some time now, but I find myself still unable to understand how I would take the idea and apply it to an image made up of a set of points like the one above. From the  wikipedia  article I have the function: 
 $G(X) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}$ 
 However, I have no idea how I actually apply that to my list of points to get a smoothed image. All of the examples online are both incredibly complicated and also for pixel-images, where every pixel in your image matters. Here, I only actually have the 20 or so points. So, what I am looking for is some explanation and advice regarding how I would apply a Gaussian blur in my way of representing the image - what do I apply $G(X)$ to (each co-ordinate?), how I calculate $\sigma^2$, etc. 
 The disclaimer : As stated, this is part of an assignment. However, this is not breaking any rules or 'cheating' in any form. The assignment is to investigate many features of online character recognition, not to magically know how to do one of the possible techniques for pre-processing the characters. Should I gain any knowledge of how to do the smoothing from this site, the site (and the individual, should they wish) will of course be credited in full. 
 I thank you for any help. I hope this question is placed correctly (I felt it was more mathematical than program-based, since it's more about the concept of Gaussian blurs rather than the implementation - I'm fairly sure I'll be able to handle that part) and that it is clear. If it is not, please just ask and I will clarify any points I can. 
 (I also apologise for the tag. I'm fairly sure it's inaccurate. But there's no 'Gaussian' tag. Tis odd.)

"Let  $f\geq 0$ . Let
 $$
\mu\left(\{x: f(x) > t\}\right) = \frac{1}{t^2 + 1}
$$ 
I'm trying to compute
 $$
\int_\mathbb{R} f\,\,d\mu
$$ 
To compute this, this is the approach I took. I know that the integral of a measurable function is
 $$
\int f\,\,d\mu = \sup\left\{\int g\,d\mu : g\text{ simple}, 0\leq g\leq f \right\}
$$ 
Further, I know that I can represent  $f$  as a non-decreasing sequence of simple functions that converges to  $f$ , as such:
 $$
f_n = n\cdot1_{B_n} + \sum_{k=1}^{n\cdot2^n}\frac{(k-1)}{2^n}1_{A_n,k}
$$ 
where
 $$
B_n = \{x: f(x) > n\}
$$ 
and
 $$
A_{n,k} = \{x: (k-1)2^{-n} < f(x) \leq k\,2^{-n}\}
$$ 
Now, since this sequence is increasing and converges to  $f$ , the sup of the set earlier would just be
 $$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\int f_n
$$ 
But, I'm unsure how exactly to calculate this. I know that if  $g$  is a simple function such that 
 $$
g = \sum^n_{k=1}c_k
$$ 
Then
 $$
\int g = \sum_{k=1}^n c_k\mu(A_k)
$$ 
But, our sequence of  $f_n$  has the  $n\cdot1_{B_n}$  as an additional term outside the summation, and for the measure of  $A_{n,k}$ , I'm unsure if I'm allowed to say that
 \begin{align}
\mu\left(\{x: (k-1)2^{-n} < f(x) \leq k\,2^{-n}\}\right) &=\\ &=\mu(\{x: f(x) > (k-1)2^{-n}\}) - \mu(\{x: f(x) > k\cdot2^{-n}\})

"I have two related questions. I'm trying to calculate the odds that at least one sequence of 30 characters (a ""30-mer"") will recur within a random sequence of one billion characters, drawn from an alphabet of four.  
 This is how I'm thinking about it: 
 
 There are $10^9 - 29$ positions a sequence can begin in. Let's just call it $10^9$ 
 There are thus $\binom{10^9}{2}$ chances to make a match 
 Given one 30-mer, the odds that another matches are $1 / 4^{30}$, which I'll approximate as $1 / 10^{18}$. 
 So, the odds of NEVER getting a single match are about
$$\left[\frac{10^{18}-1}{10^{18}}\right]^\binom{10^9}{2}

 If  $f(x) = x \sin\frac1x\;(x\ne 0), f(0) = 0$ , does Rolle's theorem guarantee a root of  $f'(x)$  in the interval  $0\le x \le \frac 1{\pi}$ ? Show that  $f'(x)$  has an infinite number of roots  $x_l \gt x_2 \gt x_3\gt \cdots$  in the given interval which may be put in one-to-one correspondence with the roots of  $\tan y = y\,$  in the interval  $\pi \le y \lt \infty$ . Calculate  $x_1$  to three decimal places.  
 
 Given  $f(x) = x \sin\frac1x(x\ne 0), f(0) = 0$ .   
At  $x=0, f(0) = 0 \sin(\infty)$ , but  $\sin(\infty)\in[-1,1]$ , which means the range corresponding to  $x=0$  is undefined. 
 But, the value of  $f(0)$  is stated to be  $0$ . This is a point of confusion as how this range point is specified.   
 Also at  $x =\frac 1{\pi}$ , the fn. yields  $f(x) = \frac 1{\pi} \sin(\pi) =0.$   
 So,  $f(0)= f\left(\frac 1{\pi}\right) = 0$ . 
 Rolle's theorem needs three conditions:   
 
 Let  $f(x)$  be continuous on a closed interval  $[a, b]$ , 
 and,  $f(x)$  be differentiable on the open interval  $(a, b)$ . 
 If  $f(a) = f(b)$ , then there is at least one point  $c$  in  $(a, b)$  where  $f'(c) = 0$ . 
 
 By being a product of polynomial & a trigonometric function, both of which are differentiable & continuous, the product too is. 
 Hence, all three conditions are satisfied. So, root of  $f'(x)$  is guaranteed in the given interval  $\big[0,\frac{1}{\pi}\big]$ . 
 First need calculate  $x_1$ , so find  $f'(x)$ .  
It is given by  $\sin\left(\frac 1x\right)-\frac 1x \cos \left(\frac 1x\right)$ . 
 $f'(x)=0\implies x\sin\left(\frac 1x\right)=\cos \left(\frac 1x\right)\implies x=\cot\left(\frac 1x\right)$ . 
 Unable to solve further. 
 I hope that the solution of the above equation can help with the rest two questions, although have doubts for each as stated below: 
 
 $f'(x)$  has an infinite number of roots  $x_l \gt x_2 \gt x_3\gt \cdots$  in the interval  $0 \le x \le \frac 1{\pi}$ . 
Unable to understand how it is possible to have the given scenario of infinite roots in a given order. 
 These roots may be put in one-to-one correspondence with the roots of  $\tan y = y\,$  in the interval  $\pi \le y \lt \infty$ . 
Here, the two equations whose roots are to be paired are: 
 $x = \cot\left(\frac 1x\right)$  and  $ y = \tan(y)$  with connection not visible.

  Ignore air resistance. 
 
 I've seen on yahoo answer that the solution provided for second part of the question,namely the distance covered in the second interval of $1.00$ second,can be found just by realizing that the midpoint of this interval occurs $1$ second later the midpoint of the first interval(so this would allow us to calculate instantaneous velocity). 
 However I am a bit skeptical ,because after the midpoint of the first interval the brick's velocity kept raising in magnitude,so I would think that  it hasn't necessarily have to be at the midpoint of the second interval exactly $1$ second later after the first one. 
 This way I would be assuming that the brick's velocity is constant over that interval,while it isn't. 
 Another point of confusion is that I can find many intervals of $1$ second where the brick falled a distance of $40$ meters..

 My attempts 1 : I have proved that  $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{2})$ ,  $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{3})$  and  $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{7})$  are totally ramified over  $\mathbb{Q}_2$  by noting that

 But I got stuck on considering extensions as  $K_1 \mid \mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{3})$ . There seems to be only two choices: unramified and totally ramified. And I only know two facts on distinguishing them:

Then  $E \mid F$  is unramified (i.e.  $[E:F] = f(E:F)$ ).

If  $g$  is Eisensteinian over  $F$ , then  $E \mid F$  is totally ramified (i.e.  $[E:F] = e(E:F)$ ) and  $\alpha$  is a uniformizer of the extension  $E \mid F$ . 
 
 But with merely these two facts, it seems hard to calculate the ramification index and the inertia degree of the extensions like  $K_1 = \mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{3})(\sqrt{7}) \mid \mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{3})$ . For example, when I want to use  Fact 1 , the minimal polynomials of  $\sqrt{7}$  or  $\sqrt{7}+1$  both have multiple root after reduced to the residue field of  $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{3})$ , which is merely  $\mathbb{F}_2$  since we have shown that  $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{3}) \mid \mathbb{Q}_2$  is totally ramified. When I want to use  Fact 2 , it is hard to find an Eisensteinian polynomial over  $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{3})$  having  $\sqrt{7}$  or something like  $\sqrt{7}+1$  as a root, since  $e(\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}_2)=2$  and everything in  $\mathbb{Q}_2$  has extended valuation  $\geq 2$  on  $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{3})$ . So I got stuck here. 
 A similar  question  is the following: 
 Question 2 : Let  $F$  be a complete discrete valued field,  $\alpha \in F$ ,  $v_F(\alpha) \geq 1$ . Suppose  $n$  is a positive integer coprime to  $v_F(\alpha)$ . Prove that  $F(\sqrt[n]{\alpha})$  is totally ramified over  $F$  of degree  $n$ . 
 My attempts 2 : When  $F \supset \mathbb{Q}_p$ , I can divide  $v_F(\alpha)$  on both sides of  $T^n - a$  to obtain an Eisenstein polynomial over  $F$ , and hence the extension is indeed totally ramified. But this ""division"" seems to be impossible in general  $F$  not containing  $\mathbb{Q}_p$ . What can I do to handle this? 
 It seems that the two questions are closely related to something that I'm not familiar with when judging unramified extensions and totally ramified extensions.

 $$a(x-x_1)\cdots (x-x_n).$$ 
 Let's define  $f_i(x):= x-x_i$ . My idea was to calculate the derivative of  $f$  applying the  general Leibniz rule  to it's decomposition above, and to somehow obtain from it an expression of  $f'$  as a product of linear polynomials (concluding
this way our proof). 
 If I'm not wrong, since all the multinomial coefficients equal 1 and the derivative of each function  $f_i$  is one, we obtain that

 Calculate all possible values of $x$ satisfying, 
 $$\frac{\lfloor{x}\rfloor}{\lfloor{x-2}\rfloor}-\frac{\lfloor{x-2}\rfloor}{\lfloor{x}\rfloor}=\frac{8\{x\}+12}{\lfloor{x}\rfloor
 \lfloor{x-2}\rfloor}$$ 
 where $\{x\}$ stands for fractional part of $x$. 
 
 My Attempt: 
 $${\lfloor{x}\rfloor}^2-{\lfloor{x-2}\rfloor}^2={8\{x\}+12}$$ 
 ${\lfloor{x}\rfloor}^2-{\lfloor{x-2}\rfloor}^2$ is an integer, so ${8\{x\}+12}$ must also be an integer, i.e. $8\{x\}$ must be an integer. 
 As, $0\leq{\{x\}}\lt{1}$, Therefore the only integer values of $8\{x\}$ will be, 
 $$\{x\}=0 \implies 8\{x\}=0 \implies 8\{x\}+12=12$$ 
 $$\{x\}=\frac{1}{2} \implies 8\{x\}=4 \implies 8\{x\}+12=16$$ 
 $$\{x\}=\frac{1}{4} \implies 8\{x\}=2 \implies 8\{x\}+12=14$$ 
 $$\{x\}=\frac{1}{8} \implies 8\{x\}=1 \implies 8\{x\}+12=13$$ 
 On calculating , we get that $12$,$16$ can be expressed as, 
 $$16=5^2-3^2 \implies 5\leq{x}\lt 6$$ 
 but $\{x\}=\frac{1}{2}, \therefore x=5+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{11}{2}$ 
 $$12=4^2-2^2 \implies 4\leq{x}\lt 5 $$ 
 but $\{x\}=0, \therefore x=4+0=4$ 
 Therefore the only solution set is, 
 $$\bigg\{4,\frac{11}{2}\bigg\}$$

Suppose there is an urn with 6 balls. 2 of them are blue, 2 black, 2 white.
We draft four times without laying the balls back. 
Whats the probability of drafting exactly 2 blue balls? 
 My Answer
We can calculate it via the hypergeometric formula: 
 So it's
$$ p = \frac{\binom{2}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2}}{\binom{6}{4}} = \frac{2}{5} $$
Is this true or false ? 
another Idea of me would be $ p = 1/3$, beacuse each time we draw, we must draw more than 1 pairs of same balls.

"How can I calculate $(7+9i)^{-1}$? 
 So I have:  
 $(7+9i)^{-1}$ 
 $(a+bi) \cdot (7+9i)$ 
 $7a + 9ai + 7 bi + 9bi^2 = 1 + 0i$ 
 $7a + (9a + 7b)i - 9b = 1$ 
 So there are two equations: 
 1) $7a - 9b = 1$ 
 2) $9a + 7b = 0$ 
 So getting a from the first equation:  
 $a = \frac{9}{7}b$ 
 Inserting it in the second one:  
 $9 \cdot \frac{9}{7}b + 7b = 0$ 
 $\frac{81}{7}b + 7b = 0$ 
 $b = \frac{130}{7}$ 
 The correct solution should be: $\frac{7}{130}- \frac{9i}{130}$

 Consider
  $$
T\colon\ell^1\to\ell^1, (s_n)\mapsto\left(\frac{s_{n+1}}{n}\right).
$$
  Calculate the norm of $T$ and show that $T$ is compact. 
 
 1.) Operator norm of $T$ 
 What I have is the following:
$$
\lVert T\rVert=\sup\limits_{\lVert x\rVert_{\ell^1}=1}\lVert Tx\rVert_{\ell^1}=\sup\limits_{\lVert x\rVert_{\ell^1}=1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{\lvert s_{i+1}\rvert}{i}\leq\sup\limits_{\lVert x\rVert_{\ell^1}=1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\lvert s_i\rvert=1
$$
Now I do not know how to continue. 
 2.) Compactness 
 The operator $T$ can be written as 
$$
T=D\circ L,
$$
where $L$ is the Leftshift and $D\colon\ell^1\to\ell^1, (s_n)\mapsto\left(\frac{s_n}{n}\right)$. 
 The operator $L$ is bounded. Therefore I have to show that $D$ is compact, because then $T$ is (as a convolution of a bounded and a compact operator) compact, too. 
 How can I I show the compactness of $D$?

"I currently am tasked with building a multiple regression model with two predictor variables to consider.  That means there are potentially three terms in the model, Predictor A (PA), Predictor B (PB) and PA*PB. 
 In one instance, I made a LS model containing all three terms, and did simple t-tests.  I divided the parameter estimates by their standard errors to calculate t-statistics, and determined that only the intercept and PA*PB coefficients were significantly different from zero. 
 In another instance, I did stepwise regression by first creating a model with only PA, and then fit a model to PA and PB, and did an F-test based on the Sum of Squares between the two models.  The F-test concluded that PB was a significant predictor to include in the model, and when I repeated the procedure, the PA*PB coefficient was found to reduce SSE significantly as well. 
 So in summary, the t-test approach tells me that only the cross-product term PA*PB has a significant regression coefficient when all terms are included in the model, but the stepwise approach tells me to include all terms in the model.

No answer or any hints are given. 
 I was able to transform this determinant to

\right|_n.
\end{equation*} 
by a series of lengthy calculations. Of course from this I can calculate the determinant when  $y=n$ , in which case it becomes diagonal. But not sure if this is the right way to proceed if  $y\neq n$  and have no clue what to do next. Does anybody have any ideas? 
 I also established the following recurrence relation (which should not be confused with the standard recurrence for a determinant of a continuant):
 $$
f_n(x,y)=(x+n-1)f_{n-1}(x-1,y-1)+(1-n)(y-n)f_{n-2}(x-1,y-1).
$$ 
Again, one can see that it can be easily solved when  $y=n$ . But what to do when  $y\neq n$  is not clear. 
 EDIT:  It turns out that when treated as a polynomial in  $x$ , the the system of functions  $f_n(x,y)$  form an orthogonal polynomial system. I found that then  $f_n(x,y)$  is related to Meixner polynomials (from Chihara's book on orthogonal polynomials)  
 with  $f=d=0$  and  $g$  and  $h$  suitably chosen. But Muir's book was written in 19-th century, well before the Meixner polynomials were discovered by Meixner in 1934. So this problem in Muir's book is really confusing. 
 Addendum.  The problem exactly how it looks in the 1960 edition of the book:
 
 It is equivalent to the formulation I gave above after a simple eqiuivalence transformation and change of notation.

I have some wood boards that are initially similar to those in the first picture. It would be simple to join them by cutting each end at a 45° angle. 
 Boards while flat 
 However, they will not be laying flat (that is, Z=0 for all bottom edges). The bottom face will be tilted up A° from the outside such that the inside edges are raised above the Z=0 plane. (A = 30° in the picture.) My goal is to cut the ends of the boards with the same angles such that the cut edges will join face to face. 
 After the boards are tilted up, B cannot have been cut at 45° if the faces are the join. Also, the cut edge is no longer 90° from the face (like the other 3 edges on each board). How do I calculate B and C given an angle A? Essentially, the cut faces need to be parallel to the Z-axis. 
 The purpose of this calculation is because the boards can only be held steady when laying flat and the saw blade must have its angles adjusted—but to what? 
 Thanks for any help orienting my thinking about the steps for solving this problem! In other situations there would be more than 4 boards being joined, so the 45° would actually be another number (like 22.5° with 8 boards).

 My approach is: 
 Firstly we determine the sample space  $\Omega$ . So  $\Omega:= \{\{\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3\},~with~\omega_i \in \{1,...,6\}\}$ . The 3-sets  $\{\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3\}$  are non-ordered and as repitition is allowed we have  $\vert\Omega\vert={6+3-1\choose 3}$ .  
 1.) Let be  $A_1$  the set of all 3-sets which at least contain one  $1$ . We have to consider the cases in which the 3-set contains one  $1$ , two  $1's$  and three  $1's$ . Hence,  $\vert A_1 \vert= {5+2-1 \choose 2}+5+1$ . The probabilty of  $A_1$  is  $\frac{21}{56}= 0.375$ . 
 2.) Let be  $A_2$  the set of all 3-sets which at least contain one  $2$  and no  $1$ . We have to consider the cases in which the 3-set contains one  $2$ , two  $2's$  and three  $2's$ . Hence,  $\vert A_2 \vert= {4+2-1 \choose 2}+4+1$ . The probabilty of  $A_2$  is  $\frac{15}{56} \approx 0.268$ . 
 In this manner I would proceed for the remaining 3-sets.

"If we define the sum of consecutive prime numbers  $p$  up to the square root of a given positive integer  $n$  as  $S(n)=\sum\limits_{p\leq\sqrt{n}}p$ , and the prime counting function up to a given positive integer  $n$  as  $\pi(n)=\#\left\{p\leq n\right\}$ , it can be showed that  $S(n)\sim\pi(n)$  (for a proof, you can check  http://vixra.org/abs/1911.0316 ). This led me to study the positive integers for which  $S(n)=\pi(n)$ . 
 If we define set  $Q$  as the set of values of  $n$  such that  $\pi\left(n\right)=S\left(n\right)$ , the first values are  $Q=\{11,12,29,30,59,60,179,180,...\}$ , for  $\pi(n)=5,5,10,10,17,17,41,41,...$ 
 It can be conjectured that the first value of  $n$  with a concrete  $\pi\left(n\right)=S\left(n\right)$  will be always a prime number. This conjecture is a corollary of the following 
 Conjecture 1 . 
 It does not exist any squared prime number  $p^{2}$  such that  $\pi\left(p^{2}\right)=S\left(p^{2}\right)$  except of  $p_{1}=2$ . That is,  $$\pi\left(p_{n}^{2}\right)\neq\sum_{k=1}^{n}p_{k}$$ 
 If the Conjecture were false, we could have that, being  $p_m$  and  $p_{m+1}$  prime numbers such that  $p_m<p_n^2<p_{m+1}$ , then  $S\left(p_{m}\right)=S\left(p_{m}+1\right)=S\left(p_{m}+2\right)=...=S\left(p_n^{2}-1\right)=S\left(p_n^{2}\right)-p_n$ ; and as   $\pi\left(p_n^{2}\right)=S\left(p_n^{2}\right)$ , then  $p_n^{2}\in Q$ ,and  $p_n^{2}$  would be the first of a series of consecutive elements of  $Q$  until  $p_{m+1}$ . 
 The conjecture has been tested and found to be true for the first thousands of primes. 
 If we define set  $M$  as the set of values of  $n$  such that  $\pi\left(n\right)=S\left(n\right)$  and  $n$  is some prime number, we find that  $M=\{11,29,59,179,389,541,...\}$ . You can see more terms in  https://oeis.org/A329403 . And if we define  $p_{k}$  as the last prime number which is a term of  $S\left(n\right)$ , we can see that the first values of  $k$  are  $2,3,4,6,8,9,...$ , which led me to formulate the following 
 Conjecture 2 
 Set  $M$  has infinitely many elements 
 If the conjecture were true, as  $M\subset Q$ , the Conjecture implies that  $\pi\left(n\right)$  intersects  $S\left(n\right)$  infinitely many times, so  $S\left(n\right)$  is not only asymptotically equivalent to  $\pi\left(n\right)$ : it is infinitely many times equal to  $\pi\left(n\right)$ . And it would show that the number of primes between  $p_{n}^{2}$  and  $p_{n+1}^{2}$  , on average, do not differ much from  $p_{n+1}$ . 
 Questions 
 (1) Any idea of how could be proved Conjecture 1, if it is already proved? Or maybe, with more computational power than mine, if anyone could verify if the conjecture supports itself also for big numbers, it would be great. 
 (2) With my computational power, I was able only to identify the first 19 prime numbers and  $k$  values of the set (last one was  $1756397$ , for  $k=216$ ). If anyone could calculate more of them to see if the conjecture supports itself also for big numbers, it would be great. 
 (3) Any idea of how to show that Conjecture 2 is true? I guess that it could be done with some theorem of the kind of Littlewood's oscillation theorem, but as an amateur mathematician obtaining such a result is beyond my actual knowledge.

 $\lim_{x\to 0 } \frac{f(x^2)-f(0)}{\sin^2(x)}= \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{f^\prime (x^2) \cdot 2x}{2\sin(x) \cdot \cos(x)}=\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{f^\prime (x^2) \cdot 2x}{2\sin(x) \cdot \cos(x)}$. 
 I reached right here and I guess I need to do another L'Hopital, is that the right direction?

"Case 
Scientists find that bacteria alpha occurs at $25\%$ of rainforests. If bacteria alpha is in fact present, there is a $50\%$ chance of detecting it in a search. Three searches fail to detect the bacteria alpha. 
 Questions 
 1)  What is the probability that all three searches will fail to detect the bacteria, if in fact it is present?  
 Bayes' rule is given as  $$Pr(H_1|D)=\frac{P(D|H_1)*P(H_1)}{\sum P(D|H_j)*P(H_j)}$$ 
 2)  If the bacteria is recorded as absent in each of three searches, use Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probability that it is in fact present at the site.

 For  question 1 , since there is a $50\%$ chance of detecting the bacteria, therefore there is also a $50\%$ of not detecting the species when it is present. Therefore

"Before I ask you my question which I will mark in bold I will tell you what I already gathered so far. 
 
 In a previous result I have showed that the bumpfunction is smooth. The bumpfunction is defined on some intervall  $[a,b]$  with 
 $$\psi(x)\begin{cases}e^{-\frac{1}{x-a}}e^{-\frac{1}{b-x}}&\mbox{a<x<b}\\0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ 
 For more details I refer to: 
 Calculate the n-th derivative for the BUMP function 
 I also know that the bump-function can be normalized, i.e 
if  $a<b<c<d$  I can construct a smooth function  $\psi$  with the properties 
 $$\phi(x)\begin{cases}=1&\mbox{}b\leq x\leq c\\\in(0,1)&\mbox{if }a<x<b\text{ or }c < x <d\\=0 &\mbox{if }x\leq a \text{ or }x\geq d\end{cases}$$ 
 The function I came up with is: 
 $$\phi(x)=\psi_0(x)\begin{cases}\frac{\psi_1(x)}{\psi_2(x)+\psi_1(x)+\psi_3(x)}&\mbox{a<x<d}\\0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ 
 $$\psi_1(x)\begin{cases}e^{-\frac{1}{x-a}}e^{-\frac{1}{d-x}}&\mbox{a<x<d}\\0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ 
 $$\psi_2(x)\begin{cases}e^{-\frac{1}{x-a}}e^{-\frac{1}{b-x}}&\mbox{a<x<b}\\0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ 
 $$\psi_3(x)\begin{cases}e^{-\frac{1}{x-c}}e^{-\frac{1}{d-x}}&\mbox{c<x<d}\\0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ 
 What I have thought is if we have a value  $x$  which is  $a<x<b\text{ or }c < x <d$  then the nominator is bigger than the dominator i.e   $\psi(x)\in(0,1)$  because all components are also positive, if we have a value which is  $c\leq x \leq d$  then  $\psi_2$  and  $\psi_3$  are Zero and the denominator and the Nominator is the same i.e  $\psi(x)=1$ . Because the function is a product of smooth functions  $\psi_0$  itself is smooth again. 
 I am however not quite sure about this when I plotted this function on Wolfram Alpha:  
 (e^{-1/(x+0.5)}*e^{-1/(0.5-x)})/((e^{-1/(x+0.5)}*e^{-1/(-0.25-x)})+(e^{-1/(x+0.5)}*e^{-1/(0.5-x)})+(e^{-1/(x-0.25)}*e^{-1/(0.5-x)})) 
 I got a bump function however the values were not normalized as originally intended. 
 For  $a<b$  there exists also a function  $\tau$  for which we have  
 $$\tau(x)\begin{cases}=1&\mbox{}x\geq b\\\in(0,1)&\mbox{if }a<x<b\\=0 &\mbox{if }x\leq a \end{cases}$$ 
 Again I first define two helper-functions in this case 
 $$\tau_1(x)=\begin{cases} e^{-\frac{1}{x-a}} &\mbox{if } x>a\\0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ 
 $$\tau_2(x)=\begin{cases} e^{-\frac{1}{x-a}}e^{-\frac{1}{b-x}} &\mbox{if } a<x<b\\0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ 
 Then the desired function is  
 $$\tau(x)=\frac{\tau_1(x)}{\tau_1(x)+\tau_2(x)}$$ 
 
 Now my question 
 Given two smooth functions  $f,g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ 
 There exist a smooth function  $h:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$  for which we have 
 $$h(x)\begin{cases}=f(x)&\mbox{, if }x\leq a\\=g(x) &\mbox{, if }x\geq b\end{cases}$$ 
 Now if I create a function  $\tau$  for the missing interval  $(a,b)$  in the Fashion I did above then I have  $\lim_{x\downarrow a}\tau(x)=f(a)$  and  $\lim_{x\uparrow a}\tau(x)=g(b)$  as desired, but the Problem is to Show that it is smooth the function  $h(x)$  must also fullfill the condition: 
 $$\lim_{x\downarrow a}\tau^{(n)}(x)=f^{(n)}(a)\wedge \lim_{x\uparrow b}\tau^{(n)}(x)=g^{(n)}(b)\text{ for every n-th derivative} $$ 
 I don't know how I can prove this with the results I already have. 
 I actually have an idea I take two  $\tau$  functions one  $\tau_1$  goes to  $0$  as  $x$  goes to  $b$  and to  $1$  as  $x$  tends to  $a$  and another one with the exact opposite behaviour  $\tau_2$ . Then  $\tau_1(x) f(x) + \tau_2(x) g(x)$  is the function I Need but I Need help to prove that the derivatives of the  $\tau$  have the same behaviour on the border. However the Problem is that when applying the productrule to calculate for example the first derivative I would get  $\tau_1'f+\tau_1f'+\tau_2'g+\tau_2g'$ . Assuming that the derivatives of  $\tau$  have the same convergencebehaviour I would get for  $\lim_{x\uparrow b}h'(x)= g(x)+g'(x)$ . But I want only  $g'(x)$ .

 What is the  average  number of distinct numbers in N random non-negative numbers less than a thousand? 
 Given integers from 0 to 999 (inclusive). Choose N integers such that all integers are equally likely to be selected. How many distinct integers do you have in N on average? 
 [Edit: 
 I changed the following question (from a textbook about algorithms) into the one I asked above. 
 What is the average number of distinct keys that FrequencyCounter will find
among N random nonnegative integers less than 1,000, for N=10, 10^2 , 10^3 , 10^4, 10^5, and 10^6 ? 
 My understanding of the question is from 1...999 you select N numbers randomly, that is in no specific way. I think we can assume selecting each number is equally likely. Repetitions are allowed. Now do this for infinite times. Take a note of all results for each experiment somehow and assume all those results are equally likely. Now pick one of the results. How many distinct numbers are that in that result on average? 
 ] 
 Here is my attempt: 
 I can choose 1000^N different lists of numbers, that is any number may repeat with any frequency in a list of size N. 
 If I were to choose sets (distinct numbers in the list) of size N, then the number of different sets should be P(1000, N) (permutations). However in the context of the question order of the elements should not be significant, so the correct number should be C(1000, N) (combinations). 
 The probability of me choosing all distinct numbers should be Px = C(1000, N)/(1000^N). 
 Now, how do I get to calculate an average number? Is it 1000 * Px? Somehow this doesn't sound right. 
 By the way, is my understanding of  average number  correct? I mean, I do this experiment infinite times and the number of distinct numbers in that set converges to a number which we call average? Though I am guessing that number should depend on the distribution of distinct numbers and calculated accordingly.

"The value of $(1000^i \mod 7)$ alternates between 1 and 6, as such: 
 $$ 1000^0 \mod 7 = 1 $$
$$ 1000^1 \mod 7 = 6 $$
$$ 1000^2 \mod 7 = 1 $$
$$ 1000^3 \mod 7 = 6 $$ 
 But as $i$ grows larger, these expressions can no longer be calculated easily by hand. 
 I can simplify the expression as such: 
 $$ 1000^i \mod 7 = (1000 \mod 7)^i \mod 7 = 6^i \mod 7 $$ 
 But even here, when $i$ grows larger, say, when $i = 50$, the expression $6^{50} \mod 7$ isn't easy to calculate, and necessitates splitting $6^{50}$ into smaller ""pieces"" and composing them. 
 But I know that the value of $6^i \mod 7$ is very simple: it alternates between 1 and 6 depending on the parity of $i$, so I feel like there must be a way to simplify this expression to capture this alternating property without having to resort to manually calculating each one by hand.

"Given a list of size N, I would like to generate many random permutations without having to store each permutation entirely in memory. I would like to be able to calculate the next item in a given permutation, or be able to access the i-th item in a given permutation. 
 The permutations only have to feel random, and don't have to be cryptographically secure in any way. It is important that each element appears exactly once in each permutation. 
 Something like this: 
 getItem(initialList, randomSeed, index); 
 getNextItem(initialList, currentItem); 
 Are there any existing algorithms that could be used to implement this?

 Each permutation is independent, and it is okay if two permutations end up identical. 
 I need to be able to access values from multiple permutations at the same time. As an example, I might generate 10 permutations of the same initial list and then use values from each of them simultaneously.

"I begin with this problem: 
 
 Calculate the limit of $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin^n xdx$ when $n\rightarrow \infty$. 
 
 It's natural to think of recurrence relation. Let $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin^n xdx=I_n$. By integration by part: $$\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin^n xdx=-\sin^{n-1}x\cos x|_{0}^{\pi/2}+(n-1)\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin^{n-2}\cos^2 x xdx$$
or $I_n=(n-1)(I_{n-2}-I_n)$. Thus $$I_n=\frac{n}{n-1}\cdot I_{n-2}$$
So we can find a formula for $I_n$ with odd $n$ : $$I_n=\frac{2\cdot 4\cdot 6\cdots (n-1)}{3\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdots n} $$
From the recurrence relation, we have $(I_n)$ decreases and is bounded below by $0$, then it has a limit $L\ge 0$. We will prove that $L=0$. 
 Suppose $L>0$. First, consider the series $$1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots$$ 
This series diverges. Suppose the series $\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}+\cdots$ converges. Since $\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}+\cdots>\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{8}+\cdots$, the series $\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{8}+\cdots$ also converges. This yields that $1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots$ converges, which is a contradiction. So $\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}\cdots$ diverges. 
 By Lagrange theorem, there exists $c_n\in [n-1,n]$ ($n\ge 3$) such that
$$\ln (n-1)-\ln n=-\frac{1}{c_n}$$
For all $n\ge 3$: $$\frac{1}{c_3}+\frac{1}{c_5}+\frac{1}{c_7}+\cdots>\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}
{5}+\frac{1}{7}+\cdots$$
so $\frac{1}{c_3}+\frac{1}{c_5}+\frac{1}{c_7}+\cdots$ diverges by comparison test. Thus $\left[-\left(\frac{1}{c_3}+\frac{1}{c_5}+\frac{1}{c_7}+\cdots\right)\right]$ also diverges. 
 Back to our problem. Since $L>0$, then $\lim \ln I_n=\ln L$. This means $\ln(2/3)+\ln(5/4)+\cdots=\ln L$, or $-\frac{1}{c_3}-\frac{1}{c_5}-\cdots=\ln L$, contradiction. Thus $L=0$. 
 I have some questions for the above problem: 
 
 Is there another way to compute the limit of $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin^n xdx$? My solution is quite complicated 
 Rewrite $I_n$ as $\left(1-\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{5}\right)\cdots \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)$. Consider a probability problem: in a test of multiple choice questions, each question has exactly one correct answer. The first question has $3$ choices, the second has $5$ choices, etc. By the above result, if the tests has more and more questions, then the probability for the student to be false at all is smaller and smaller. This sounds interesting, because the questions have more and more choices. Is there any generalized result for this (fun) fact?

"I have to calculate the folowing: 
 $$\lim_{x\rightarrow 8}\frac{\root{3}\of{x} - 2}{\root{3}\of{3x+3}-3}$$ 
 I am not allowed to used anything else than the definition of the derivative of a function  $f(a)$  with respect to  $x$ , that is  
 $$f'(a) = \lim_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$ 
 After some thinking I found out we could define two function  $g(x) = \frac{x-3}{3}$  and  $f(x) = \root{3}\of{3x+3}$  edit: this should actually be  $h(x)$ 
 Then  $h(g(x)) = \root{3}\of{x}$ , and  $h(8) = 3\\$  and finally:  $h(g(8)) = 2$ 
 If  $f(x)$  is the first function (at the beginning), I could now rewrite it's limit as: 
 $$
\lim_{x\rightarrow 8} \frac{h(g(x)) - h(g(8))}{h(x) - h(8)}
$$  (1) 
 
 My question is: 
 If we note  $c(x) = (h(g(x)))$ , Does it make sense to write  $h(x) \rightarrow h(8)$  under the  $lim$  symbol instead of  $x\rightarrow 8$ ? Is the above limit equal to the derivative of  $c$  with respect to  $h$ ? Does this even make sense since  $h$  is applied ""after""  $g$ ? 
 
 If I just apply the chain rule: 
 $$\frac{dc}{dx} = \frac{dc}{dh}\frac{dh}{dx} \Leftrightarrow \frac{dc}{dh} = \frac{dc}{dx}\frac{dx}{dh}$$ 
 then I find a wrong limit: 
 We are looking for  $\frac{dc}{dh}$ . So we can calculate  
 $$
   \frac{dc}{dx} = \frac{1}{3\root{3}\of{(3x+3)^2}} \\
   \frac{dh}{dx} = \frac{3}{3\root{3}\of{(3x+3)^2}} \\
   \Rightarrow \frac{dc}{dh} = \frac{1}{3}
$$ 
 So the limit should be one third, but it actually turns out to be  $\frac{3}{4}$ . 
 Why can't we write the limit  $(1)$  as  $\frac{dc}{dh}$ , and more importantly, how can I get the correct limit using the definition of the derivative? 
 
 PS: I'm not sure if it's even possible because the exercise doesn't say which method to use (I know it's possible using the factorization of  $a^3 - b^3$ ). I just find it would be really cool to solve the exercise this way 
 
 Edit 
 I have made a mistake on the derivative of  $h(g(x)) = \root{3}\of{x}$ . I used the chain rule  $c'(x) = h'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)$  and that led to a mistake. I should simply have derived  $c(x) = \root{3}\of{x}$ . So the actual derivative is  $\frac{1}{3\root{3}\of{x^2}}$ . This leads to the correct limit, as showed in farruhota's answer.

"I've recently learned about character tables, and some of the tricks for computing them for finite groups (quals...) but I've been having problems actually doing it. Thus, my question is (A) how to finish the following question (I am ok with general techniques, I can work out the particulars of the calculations) and (B) any tricks that are helpful to do the following types of questions: 
 The question is  
 Let $G$ be the group of order 16 with the presenation
$$
\langle x,y | x^8=y^2 = 1, yxy^{-1} = x^3 \rangle
$$ 
 Compute the conjugacy classes and construct the character table. 
 
 I compute the conjugacy classes to be  
 $\{id\}$ 
 $\{x,x^3\}$  
 $\{ x^2,x^6 \}$ 
 $\{x^4\}$ 
 $\{x^5,x^7\}$ 
 $\{xy,x^3y,x^7y,x^5y\}$ 
 $\{y,x^2y,x^6y,x^4y\}$ 
 
 So, I calculate that there are 7 conjugacy classes, so there are 7 representations. The trivial represenation is one, and there is another one given by the nontrivial representation of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \simeq G /\langle x\rangle$, i.e. $-1$ on the last two conjugacy classes and $1$ otherwise.  
 So, now I need 5 squares to sum to 14, which must be $1^2+1^2+2^2+2^2+2^2$. So, there are still two more $1$-dimensional representations, so there should be another normal subgroup, so some playing around (is there a fast way to see this?) I the even powers of $x$ to be a normal subgroup, with quotient the Klein 4 group, so I can fill in the other 1 dim reps. 
 Now, here is where I get stuck. How do I find a 2 dimensional representation? I assume that once I find one, I can just tensor the 1-dim reps to finish the character table? Is this the best way? I don't see an obvious way to write down a representation of $G$, so perhaps I should use induction? From what subgroup? 
 
 Alternatively, I could use the quotient $G/\langle x^4\rangle$, which is a nonabelian group of order 8, so without much work I should be able to write down its character table, but do other groups with similar presentations that I will see still have this nice property that the center quotients to something simpler - and even if it did, how do I construct a higher dim representation in any other case if I dont recognize the quotient group as something I can explicitly write as a symmetry group of some shape?

 (1) Is there any quick way(or some known result) to calculate $da\wedge da$, or the only way is to expand it one by one, just like expanding the product of polynomials? Since this is the first time for me to do this kind of calculation, I am not sure I am doing it in the right or usual way.

"Recently, the following question was asked:  Without calculator, find out what is larger:  $60^\frac{1}{3}$  or  $2+7^\frac{1}{3}$ . (Apologies; I don't know how to link to that question, but it is not essential for the question I am asking.) 
 Most people would not be able to extract cube roots without a calculator, unless the numbers were particularly easy, such as  $64^\frac{1}{3}$  or  $2+8^\frac{1}{3}$ . But not using a calculator does not rule out doing some calculation. 
 As it turns out, the numbers in this case lend themselves to reasonably calculable approximations, which many people could perform in their heads, but might prove daunting to less experienced individuals. 
 So my question is, are the calculations I made reasonably within the intention of the restriction ""without calculator?"" 
 Please consider the difficulty of the calculations, not the total amount of calculation performed. Here is what I did, emphasizing the arithmetic calculation aspects: I cubed both quantities, leaving me to compare  $60$  with  $8+12(7^\frac{1}{3})+6(7^\frac{2}{3})+7$ . 
 Collecting terms and rearranging, the original question becomes one about a quadratic equation: 
 Is  $$x^2+2x-7.5$$  greater or less than  $0$  when  $x=7^\frac{1}{3}$ ? 
 This in turn becomes: Is  $7^\frac{1}{3}$  greater or less than  $r$ , the positive root of  $$x^2+2x-7.5=0$$ . 
 By the quadratic formula  $$r=(-2+\sqrt{4+30})/2$$ . 
 Although the square root of  $34$  may look like one of those calculations that would require a calculator, it turns out that determining a precise value would just make subsequent calculations dependent on a calculator as well. 
 By good fortune (or the cleverness of the original poser of the question),  $34$  is close to  $36$ , so we may approximate  $\sqrt{34}$  as  $(6-a)$ . 
 Thus we look for  $$34=36-12a+a^2$$ . 
 But since  $a$  will be small compared to  $6$ , we can approximate by ignoring the  $a^2$  term and calculate  $a=\frac{1}{6}$ . it is easy to see that  $(6-\frac{1}{6})^2$  exceeds  $34$  by  $\frac{1}{36}$ . Again, by seeming good fortune, the next reasonable fraction greater than  $\frac{1}{6}$  is  $\frac{17}{100}$ . 
 $$(6-\frac{17}{100})^2$$  is also calculable as  $$36-\frac{204}{100}+\frac{289}{10000}$$ . Since the second term decrements  $36$  by  $2.04$  and the third term only restores  $0.0289$ , we see that  $(6-\frac{17}{100})^2$$ is less than $ 34$. So $$(6-\frac{1}{6})>\sqrt{34}>(6-\frac{17}{100})$$, hence $$(2-\frac{1}{12})>r>(2-\frac{17}{200})$$. 
 What remains is to cube the numerical  values bracketing  $r$  and compare the results to  $7$ . 
 $$(2-\frac{1}{12})^3=8-1+\frac{1}{24}-\frac{1}{1728}$$  which is greater than  $7$  by observation. 
 $$(2-\frac{17}{200})^3=8-\frac{204}{200}+6(\frac{289}{40000})-(\frac{17}{200})^3=8-\frac{204}{200}+(\frac{1734}{40000})-(\frac{17}{200})^3$$ . 
 The arithmetic is a little harder here, but the first and second terms are less than  $7$  by  $0.02$  and the third term is reasonably seen to be greater than  $0.04$ , making the sum of the first three terms greater than  $7$  by at least  $0.02$ . The last term is certainly smaller than  $(\frac{20}{200})^3$  which is  $0.001$ , so the sum of the terms is greater than 7. 
 This means that  $r^3>7$  or  $$r>7^\frac{1}{3}$$ . From this, the original question can be answered. In performing calculations, no roots were extracted, but binomial expressions up to cubes involving fractions were calculated. I personally found the numbers in the numerators and denominators tractable, but would this be considered by the community as being in the spirit of ""without calculator?""

"The objective is to take a pair of vectors and rotate them so that they match another pair of vectors, their corresponding pair.  
 The paper describing this says to minimize the error function:
 $ Err  = \sum ||n'-Rn||^2 $ 
 Where n is the orientation vector. 
 The textbook the paper tags then says to use Quaternions to minimize this error function and get the unknown R. 
 The textbook breaks down the derivation as follows, after applying quaternions: 
 $ Err  = \sum |n'-q\times n\times \bar q|^2 $ 
 Using q^2 = 1 we can multiply that into the above equation and compress some terms again using this rule to get down to: 
 $ Err  = \sum |n'\times q - q\times n|^2 $ 
 According to the textbook: It follows from the definition of the product of the quaternion that  $n'\times q - q\times n$  is a linear function of the 4 coordinates of q. Thus there is a 4x4 matrix A such that: 
 $|n'\times q - q\times n|^2  = q^TA^TAq $ 
 so we need to find the min of the above right hand side.
The solution to this is the smallest eigenvalue - eigenvector pair of the matrix  $A^TA$ .

 I am not able to figure out anything because of that  $a$ . The best I can figure out is that I will find the roots of  $P(x)$  because  $a$  is not computable as there is no way of finding out the zeros of  $P(x-3)$ . If I would have been able to find the roots of  $(x^2-ax+18)$  then I would have been able to figure out what to do. 
 If there would have been no  $a$  I would have found of the roots of  $P(x)$  like for example  $\alpha, \beta$  then I would have written out  $P(x)$  in the form of  $(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)Q(x)$  for  $Q(x)$  being any polynomial. Then I would have tried to calculate the answer.

"In my probability book I learned how to solve this kind of problem: how many vectors of the form  $(i_1,i_2,...,i_r)$  exist that the sum of its components is  $n$  and  $i_k>0$  for all  $k$ ? The answer uses the stars and bars argument and is  $n-1\choose r-1$ . 
 OK, now I have this really simple problem: imagine you'll roll  $2$  six-faced dice, how many ways there are in which the sum of them is  $n$ ?  
 First I thought to use the before mentioned method, considering a result as a vector of the form  $(i_1,i_2)$  but I realized that I have a new restriction,  $i_1,i_2 \leq 6$ ! I thought about it and I don't know how to compute it without considering case by case ( $n=2,n=3,...,n=12$ ), I've done it with the six-faced die, since there's only  $11$  cases and found a nice 'triangular pattern', but what if the dice had each  $20$  faces?

"So I've been looking for a formula where I can input the parameter $k$ and it will give me a formula for $1^k+2^k+3^k...+ n^k$ with $n,k \in \mathbb{N}$. The result is always a polynomial with $k+1$ as highest power. I've taken the time to calculate the polynomes for $k=1$ to $k=10$ by hand and using the interpolation feature of Wolfram Alpha. Here are the results (I'll only show the coefficients for the sake of clarity. the coefficients are always from $n^{k+1}$ to $n^1$. the constant is always $0$. So $\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}$ becomes $\frac{1}{2}n^2-\frac{1}{2}n$): 
 
 $k=1$ : $\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}$ 
 $k=2$ : $\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{6}$ 
 $k=3$ : $\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4},0$ 
 $k=4$ : $\frac{1}{5},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},0,-\frac{1}{30}$ 
 $k=5$ : $\frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{2},\frac{5}{12},0,-\frac{1}{12},0$

Secondly, the coefficient of the second highest power seems to be $\frac{1}{2}$ with the exception of $k=1$. Thirdly, all coefficients of the fourth, sixth, eight highest power and so on seem to be $0$.

 My attempt: The matrix is  $\begin{pmatrix}3&2&0\\-2&0&1\\0&1&1\end{pmatrix}$  as it is the effect of the linear map on the standard basis vectors of  $\mathbb{R}^3$ . (I'm not sure if the matrix is this or the transpose though...). 
 The kernel is the set  $(x,y,z)$  such that  $M(x,y,z)=\bf{0}$ , which we can calculate to be  $(0,0,0)$  and so  $dim(Ker f)=1$ , as there is only one set of vectors satisfying the condition. 
 Since  $ker=(0,0,0), L$  is 1-1 (how do I show this?). To show invertibility, I use the rank nullity theorem.  $dim L=9, dim Ker f=1$ , so  $dim(im f)=8\ne 0$  and so it is invertible.

"An actuary has done an analysis of all policies that cover two cars.  $70 \%$  of the policies are of type A for both cars, and  $30 \%$  of the policies are of type B for both cars. The number of claims on different cars across all policies are mutually independent. The distributions of the number of claims on a car are given in the following table. 
 
 Four policies are selected at random. Calculate the probability that exactly one of the four policies has the same number of claims on both covered cars. 
 Attempt: 
 Let  $N$  be the number of claims. Let  $X$  be the event that exactly one of the 4 policies has same number of claims. We want to find  $P(X)$ . Notice we have 
 $$ P(X) = P(X|A)P(A) + P(X|B)P(B)$$ 
 We know  $P(A) = 0.7$  and  $P(B) = 0.3$ . Now, we need to find  $P(X|A)$  and  $P(X|B)$ . Now, we find  $P(X|A)$ . We have 
 $$ P(X|A) = \sum_{i=0}^4 P([X|A] | N=i) P(N=i) $$ 
 And  $[X|A]|N$  is  $binomial$  with parameters  $n=3$  and  $p = P(N=i)$ . so for example, 
 $$ P([X|A]|N=0) = {3 \choose 0} 0.4^0 0.6^3 \approx 0.216 $$ 
 $$ P([X|A]|N=1) = {3 \choose 1} 0.4^1 0.6^2 \approx 0.432 $$ 
 $$P([X|A]|N=2) = {3 \choose 2} 0.4^2 0.6^1 \approx 0.288$$ 
 $$P([X|A]|N=3) = {3 \choose 3} 0.4^3 0.6^0 \approx 0.064$$ 
 Now, we use same procedure to find  $P(X|B)$ .

  You roll a die until you get a  $m$  where  $1\leq m\leq n$ . 
  Calculate the expected value of the minimum rolled.  
 
 The original interview question takes  $n=6$  (standard fair die) and  $m=5$ . 
I mange to solve the problem and I reproduce my attempt below. 
 The expected minimum value rolled is  $\frac{137}{60}$  because if  $X$  is the minimum value rolled up to and including  $5,$  then 
 $$P(X=x) = \frac{1}{x(x+1)} \quad \text{for }x=1,2,3,4 \quad \text{and} \quad P(X=5) = \frac{1}{5}.$$ 
So, 
 $$E(X) = \sum_{x=1}^5 xP(X=x) = \frac{137}{60}.$$ 
 I am trying to solve the generalized version of the problem. 
 
 By the same spirit, let  $Y$  be the minimum value rolled up to and including  $m.$  Then 
 $$P(Y=y) = \frac{(y-1)!}{(y+1)!} = \frac{1}{y(y+1)} \quad \text{for }y =1,2,...,m-1 \quad \text{and}\quad P(Y=m) = \frac{1}{m}.$$ 
Therefore,
 $$E(Y) = \sum_{y=1}^m y P(Y=y) = 1 + \sum_{y=1}^{m-1} \frac{1}{y+1} = 1 + \sum_{y=2}^{m} \frac{1}{y}.$$

 Show that  in particular case of  the cycloid  ( $a > 0$ is a constant), 
 $$\gamma (t) = a(t − \sin t, 1 − \cos t), 0 <t< 2\pi ,$$  
 the evolute is 
 $$\epsilon (t) = a(t + \sin t, −1 + \cos t), $$  
 and that after a suitable re-parametrization $\epsilon$ can be obtained from $\gamma$ by a translation of the plane.

"I am trying to calculate the Fourier Transform of $g(t)=e^{-\alpha|t|}$, where $\alpha > 0$. 
 Because there's an absolute value around $t$, that makes $g(t)$ an even function, correct? If that's the case, then I made the assumption that I can calculate FT integral from $0$ to $\infty$ and then multiply the result by $2$ to get the answer: 
 $G^*(f) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\alpha t} e^{-j\omega t}dt = G(f) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-(j\omega + \alpha)t}dt = \frac{e^{-(j\omega + \alpha)t}}{-(j\omega + \alpha)}\bigg|_0^\infty = 0 - \frac{1}{-(j\omega + \alpha)} = \frac{1}{j\omega + \alpha}$ 
 $G(f) = 2G^*(f) = \frac{2}{j\omega + a}$

"It's been a good few years since I've had to touch logs with my job, however today I found myself trying to calculate 570=a(1.5)^n for a theoretical pressure system.  
 Something in my head from high school tells me that I need to use logs to solve for a and n. Admittedly I could do it using a graph but I'd quite like to be able to do logs again as I know they are useful. 
 So onto the question. Just how do I utilise logs to solve 570=a(1.5)^n for a and n. 
 So far I have used my basic knowledge and taken logs of both sides (possibly not correctly) to get - 
 log570=nlog1.5a  
 Then I rearranged to get -  
 n=(log570/log1.5a) 
 This is where i'm stuck. I haven't got 'a' so I can't do anything more at this point, can I? 
 The basic formula I am using is T=ap^n. My values for T and p are 570 and 1.5 respectively. 
 EDIT- 
 I have been told to work it out using T=570 when p=1.5 AND T=510 when p=1. I am an idiot and pieces of paper have two sides... 
 However if I implement this into my equation as above, I am still confused.I now have -

 ORIGINAL POST: 
 Hi ::- D. I'm working on a (Flash) game and I have a weapon from which a projectile departs. The projectile travels along a line. I have the slope of the line as well as the origin (1 point). I want to calculate, depending on the Distance, where should I draw the projectile, frame by frame. The distance increases with a certain quantity each frame, as the projectile travels along the line. 
 I have tried my best to solve this and this is what I did so far. I would not mind if you know a simpler way, but I would very much appreciate it if you would tell me why my method doesn't work (the coordinates I'm getting are very chaotic). 
 I used these equations to build a system: 
 http://www.analyzemath.com/Calculators/TwoPointsCalculator.html 
 d = sqrt [ (x1 -x2)^ + (y1 - y2)^ ]

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
 
 I took out y2: 
 y2 = m * x2 - m * x1 + y1
 
 From that equation, I know everything except x2.  x1, y1 and m are all known . I'm out to find x2 and y2 which are the coordinates of my desired point. 
 I removed the radical by squaring the first equation and also breaking (solving) the paranthesis. I should mention it's been a very long time since I did any math so please excuse the lack of correct terminology. Also, I'm unfamiliar with how to produce a fast MathJaX of the equations, but I think they're simple enough to be written normally. ^ - means square. I used some extra paranthesis to clear it up. 
 d^ = x1^ - (2 * x2 * x1) + x2^ + y1^ - (2 * y2 * y1) + y2 ^
 
 Ok so I also know who  d  is. Now, I took y2 and substituted it in the above equation. This is what resulted: 
 d^ = x1^ - 2 * x2 * x1  + x2^ + y1^ - 2 * y1 * (m * x2 + K) + (m * x2 +K) ^
 
 Where K is that part which I can calculate from the above y2 equation: y2 = m* x2  -m * x1 + y1 
 So now I got an equation where I know everything except x2. I reduced this equation to a quadratic equation. The final form (I solved the squared parenthesis above as well) is: 
 x2^ ( - 1 - m^) + x2 (2 * x1   + 2 *  y1 * m - 2 * m * K) + d^ - x1^ - y1^ + 2 * y1 * K - K ^ = 0
 
 Looks scary doesn't it?  laugh . 
 This seems to be correct so far. Because we're talking about a line, slope and distance, it's obvious that there can be  TWO  points which are of distance D from my Origin (x1, y1). So I solve the quadratic equation in order to find x2-1 and x2-2 which I can then take to my first equation and get y2-1 and y2-2. So, I moved to solve the quadratic equation. First, I found a, b and c. 
 a = -1 - m^
b = (2 * x1   + 2 *  y1 * m - 2 * m * K) 
c = d^ -  x1^ - y1^  + 2 * y1 * K - K ^ 
 
 And now, I found the 2 roots: 
 x2 = (-b + sqrt (b^ - 4ac)) / 2a
x2 = (-b - sqrt (b^ - 4ac)) / 2a
 
 Then, I found the two y2 points. And that's it ::- D. 
 It doesn't work  laugh ......... I worked for hours this morning, flexing whatever pathetic math muscles I got left and I worked all this far to end up with: 
 (x=1509141.9643610462, y=20806970.245399687) 
 This, in a case where the origin is at 200, 250 and the distance is 1 and the slope is 2.2 or -0.7 or whatever....... 
 Sometimes, I even get NaN (that is, Not A Number, invalid value in ActionScript 3). So the values I'm getting are DEFINITELY not related to my origin. 
 A point of interest however: for slope = 1.380657160570366, my projectile  ACTUALLY SEEMS TO WORK , as in, it appears a bit TOO far from the Origin (about 50 pixels), but it  DOES MOVE  along the correct line, albeit, strangely, it ACCELERATES, even though I never increase its speed, I simply increase the distance: 
 _ProjectileDistance += _ProjectileSpeed;
var newCoords: Point = GetPointAlongLine(weaponRootPointX, weaponRootPointY, _ProjectileDistance, _ProjectileSlope);
Projectile.x = newCoords.x;
Projectile.y = newCoords.y;
 
 And for those who know programming as well, here is what all I said looks like in code: 
   var a: Number = - 1 - slope * slope;
  var b: Number = 2 * x1 + 2 * y1 * slope - 2 * slope * y2KnownPart;
  var c: Number = distance*distance - x1*x1 - y1*y1 - 2 * y1 * y2KnownPart - y2KnownPart*y2KnownPart;

  var x2Root1: Number = (- b + Math.sqrt(b*b - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a);
  var x2Root2: Number = (- b - Math.sqrt(b*b - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a);
  var y2Root1: Number = slope * x2Root1 + y2KnownPart;
  var y2Root2: Number = slope * x2Root2 + y2KnownPart;

 $$ \Gamma_{ij}^k = \frac12 \sum_m \frac{1}{Z_{km} } \left[ \frac{\partial Z_{mj}}{\partial Z^i}+  \frac{\partial Z_{mi}}{\partial Z^j} - \frac{\partial Z_{ij}}{\partial Z^m}\right] 
$$ 
 Note that I kind of 'broke' the contraction here, but still the summation over  $m$  exists. I've kept the symbol outside, to be clear about it. I am confused on how to apply the observation -1, I considered that putting  $m=j=i$  but the expression resulting from that doesn't seem too right. 
 
 My proof of (2):
Consider the identity between matrix and it's inverse in tensor notation  $A_k^i B_j^k=\delta_j^i$ , for an orthonormal matrix  $A$  the only existing terms are only the diagnol ones, this leads to:  $A_i^i B_j^i =\delta_j^i$ , now we want the non zero entries. For that  $i=j$  is the condition, hence we get the non zero entries in  $B$  as required.

"I have found this riddle in my book and so far which may require the use of calculus (integrals) to which I'm familiar but not very savvy with it. Since, I've not yet come with an answer. I wonder if such problem can be also solved using sums in the scope of college precalculus like an approximation (proven) which could be solved by hand even the calculus method which I also feel might also help me. 
 The problem is as follows:  
 
 In a research facility in Taiwan a group of technicians built a new
  optical disk which stores information in a spiral engraved in its
  bottom face named ""lecture side"". Under the microscope it can be seen
  that the spiral begins in a region starting from  $\textrm{2.6 cm}$ 
  from its axis of rotation and it ends at  $\textrm{5.7 cm}$  from the
  center of the disk. It can also be seen that individual turns of the
  spiral are  $0.74\,\mu\textrm{m}$ . Using this information calculate
  the length of the entire track. 
 
 So far I've only come with the idea of using the spiral of Archimedes, whose formula is given as follows: 
 $$r=a+b\phi$$ 
 However, I'm not very familiar with the realm of polar coordinates or how can this equation be used to solve my problem.
To better illustrate the situation, however I've drawn this sketch to show how I'm understanding the problem. 
 
 I've included a cartesian grid, which well ""may not be"" in scale. But gives an idea of how I believe it is intended to be said. 
 I've really wanted to offer more into this such as an attempt into solving, but so far I've ran out of ideas. 
 However, I've come with the idea that the solution may be linked with finding how many turns are in the ""readable sector"" which is alluded in the problem. 
 To calculate this what I did was the following: 
 $\textrm{number of turns}= \left( 5.7 - 2.6 \right)\times 10^{-2}\textrm{m}\times \frac{\textrm{1 turn}}{0.74\times 10^{-6}\textrm{m}}$ 
 By evaluating this short conversion factors I obtained 
 $\textrm{number of turns} = 41891.89189\,\textrm{turns or rad}$ 
 And that's it. But from there I don't know how to relate this information with what would be needed to solve this riddle. The answer in the book states that the track's length is  $1.09\times 10^{4}\,\textrm{m}$ . But again. I don't know what can I do to get there. 
 So far I've did some preliminary research in the community and I've found  this  but it isn't really very helpful as the example relates to a vertical helix going upwards around a cylinder and my situation doesn't fit into this. Other proposed methods such  as the one  seen here propose using calculus and this also is referenced  here . Needless to say that the only existing solution doesn't give much details of how the supposed formula works. It also contributes to the problem that I'm not very savvy with it and since this problem was obtained from a precalculus book, I aimed my question to. Does it exist a method to make this computation relying in college algebra?. With this I don't intend to totally discard a calculus approach, but an answer with would really be very pedagogical for me is one which can show me the two methods, so I can compare which can be better according to my current knowledge so I can practice more in what I feel I'm lacking. 
 Well that's it. I do really hope somebody could help me with the two methods, one using algebra and another using calculus.

"I'm reading Marcel B. Finan's  A Basic Course in the Theory of Interest and Derivatives Markets: A Preparation for the Actuarial Exam FM/2  and have difficulty with two of his questions. 
 Problem 9.6 (page 73) is (paraphrased): 
 
 Given that $$1+\frac{i^{(n)}}n=\frac{1+\frac{i^{(4)}}4}{1+\frac{i^{(5)}}5}$$ find $n$. 
 
 (Note that $i^{(k)}$ denotes the nominal annual interest rate, which is convertible $k$ times per year for an effective annual interest rate $>i^{(k)}$ (when $k>1$). I assume that the three nominal annual interest rates in this question are the same, although the question doesn't so specify, since if they're not then there's obviously no way to figure out this problem.) 
 My only idea of how to solve this problem was that the right-hand side is the accumulation of $1+\frac{i^{(5)}}5$ over the next $\frac14-\frac15=\frac1{20}$ years, which would make $n=20$. But while that makes sense, I'm not sure it's correct and would welcome any feedback or ideas on how to solve this. 
 Problem 9.9 (page 74) is: 
 
 Eric deposits $X$ into a savings account at time 0, which pays interest at a nominal rate of $i$, compounded semiannually. Mike deposits $2X$ into a different savings account at time 0, which pays simple interest at an annual rate of $i$. Eric and Mike earn the same amount of interest during the last 6 months of the 8th year. Calculate $i$. 
 
 I've got $$X\left((1+\frac i2)^{16}-(1+\frac i2)^{15}\right)=2X(1+\frac i2)$$ and thus $$i(1+\frac i2)^{14}=4$$ but have no idea how to proceed from there. Any help would be much appreciatred.

"This topic seems to have been discussed in this forum about 6 years ago. I have reviewed most of the answers. The proof I have is labelled Cantor's Second Proof and takes up about half a page (Introduction to Real Analysis - Robert G. Bartle and Donald R. Sherbert page 50). I apologise if I missed something important but all the answers seem to just make the subject more obscure. The proof by Bartle and Sherbert is relatively straight forward but on reflexion I have found 3 objections: 
 
 No infinite list is  constructed . They are just produced - like those cookery TV shows - here is a cake I made earlier. I think with something so fundamental it should be exaplained  how the cake was made . 
 The proof demonstrates that there are missing numbers from the list but does not state or prove how many. 
 If you include the construction of the infinite numbers you arrive at a paradox. 
 
 My argument (I doubt if it could be understood by a 5 year old but a smart 12 year old should be able to follow it): 
 Let us start with a finite list. To keep the numbers small let's use binary. Assume an n*n structure with n=3.  The structure looks like this: 
 
 000 
 001 
 010 
 
 Now one can easily find a three digit number missing from the list, e.g. 100. A combination of 3 digit binary numbers gives 8 values (if 0 is included). (A 3 digit base 10 number has 1,000 possibilities of course). So n messages each with n digits will always have missing values. There is no mystery here. It is just basic school mathematics. In fact we can calculate the exact number of missing numbers.  
 For n digits in base b there are exactly $b^n$ possible numbers that can be created.  So we create a finite list with n digits and $b^n$ numbers. We have constructed this so there are no missing numbers. If we apply the diagonal argument to this list we cannot create any more numbers unless we add digits. 
 Now comes the possibly interesting part: 
What happens if we take a limit as $n \to \infty$? 
 Well there are two ways to do this and this is where the paradox comes in: 
 (1) It would seem reasonable to assume that $b^n$ expands faster then n.
So let's swap this around and call $b^n = K$. Then the number of digits is $\log K$. So we allow $K \to \infty$. But then $\log K \to \infty$. But note from this construction:  There are no missing numbers. 
 (2) Let's take the opposite view and assume an $n \times n$ structure. We have shown above this has exactly $b^n-n$ missing possible number combinations. We let $n \to \infty$. So in this case: there are $b^\infty-\infty$ missing numbers. This construction supports Cantor's argument. 
 I think the Paradox resolves around defining a number as an infinite list. In which case you can apply argument (2). But you cannot derive this by construction. This seems to imply the impossibility of constructing the irrational numbers. We need first an infinite set as a static data structure. But there is no such thing. An infinite set is the result of a process which as a limit to oo can never be completed. oo itself is not a number. 
 So how is this Paradox resolved?

"I am trying to calculate integrals of the form:  
 $$ I(t, n) =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Big(\frac{1}{1-jq}\big)^{n} e^{-jqt} dq $$ 
 where  $j = \sqrt{-1}$ . In the case when  $n=1$ , I have: 
 $$ I(t, 1) =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1-jq} e^{-jqt} dq $$ 
 Now, my thought was to view this as a function of  $t$ , and use the Feynmann trick. Ie: 
 $$ \frac{d}{dt} I(t, 1) =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \big(\frac{1}{1-jq} e^{-jqt} \big) dq $$ 
 $$ \frac{d}{dt} I(t, 1) =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{-jq}{1-jq} e^{-jqt} dq $$ 
 This looks promising, but I can't get it to go anywhere. An even more promising avenue seems to be to express the exponential as a power series around zero. This gives: 
 $$ I(t, 1) =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1-jq} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-jqx)^{k}}{k!} dq $$ 
 Since the complex exponential is entire, we can interchange the sum and integral, giving: 
 $$ I(t, 1) =  \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{k}}{k!} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{(-jq)^{k}}{1-jq}   dq $$ 
 However, I get stuck here too because I can't find an antiderivative for the integrand. 
 Any ideas? Am I missing some fundamental theoretical concept or trick or technique that makes all of this difficulty disappear? 
 Unfortunately, I am really not that good at integration, but I want to get better!

Could someone please help me understand the reasoning behind (what appears to me as) the counter-intuitive naming of $P$ as the change of basis matrix from $S$ to $S'$?

 I am trying to understand the above definitions with this example: 
 Basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^{2}: S= \{u_1,u_2\}=\{(1,-2),(3,-4)\}$ and $S' = \{v_1,v_2\}= \{(1,3), (3,8)\}$ the change of basis matrix from $S$ to $S'$ is $P = \left( \begin{array}{cc} -\frac{13}{2} & -18 \\ \frac{5}{2} & 7 \end{array} \right)$. 
 My current understanding is the following: normally vectors such as $u_1, u_2$ are written under the assumption of the usual basis that is $u_1 = (1,-2) = e_1 - 2e_2 = [u_1]_E$. So actually $[u_1]_S = (1,0)$ and I guess this would be true in general... But I am not really understanding what effect if any $P$ is supposed to have on the basis vectors themselves (I think I understand the effect on the coordinates relative to a basis). I guess I could calculate a matrix $P'$ which has the effect  $P'u_1, P'u_2,...,P'u_n = v_1, v_2,..., v_n$ but would this be anything?

 As in a previous  StackExchange question , the simple Bayes's problem is usually framed as below: 
 
 Marie is getting married tomorrow, at an outdoor ceremony in the
  desert. In recent years, it has rained only 5 days each year.
  Unfortunately, the weatherman has predicted rain for tomorrow. When it
  actually rains, the weatherman correctly forecasts rain 90% of the
  time. When it doesn't rain, he incorrectly forecasts rain 10% of the
  time. What is the probability that it will rain on the day of Marie's
  wedding? 
 
 To use common notation with the selected answer in that question, let  $R$  denote the event that it actually rains (prior). And  $P$  denote the event that the weather forecaster is correct. 
 We can then apply Baye's to calculate  $P(R|P)$ . 
 However, in reality, weather forecasters themselves seem to issue  probabilities  that it will rain as opposed to a binary response. For example, the weather forecaster says there is a 70% chance it will rain tomorrow (while being correct only 90% of the time, as before).

 Lemma. Let  $M$  be a close subspace of a Hilbert space  $\mathcal{H}$ . Then  $\mathcal{H} = M \oplus M^{\perp}$ , where  $\oplus$  denotes the orthogonal direct sum. 
 
 Proof.
Let  $x \in \mathcal{H}$ .
We aim to decompose  $x = x_1 + x_2$  with  $x_1 \in M$  and  $x_2 \in M^{\perp}$ .
First, we define  $K := x - M$ .
Since  $M$  is closed, so is  $K$ .
Furthermore  $K$  is convex.
By a lemma there exists a unique  $x_2 \in K$  such that  $\| x_2 \| = \inf_{y \in K} \| y \|$ .
By definition of  $K$  there exists some  $x_1 \in M$  such that  $x_2 = x - x_1$ . 
 It now remains to show that  $x_2 \in M^{\perp}$ .
Let  $y \in M \setminus \{0\}$  be arbitrary.
Then,  $\| x_2 \|^2 \le \| x_2 - \lambda y \|^2$  holds for all  $\lambda \in \mathbb{K}$  since  $x_2 - \lambda y \in K - M = K$ .
Choosing  $\lambda := \dfrac{\langle x_2, y \rangle}{\langle y, y, \rangle}$  we obtain
 \begin{equation*}
 0
 \le \left \| x_2 - \frac{\langle x_2, y \rangle}{\langle y, y, \rangle} y \|^2 - \| x_2 \right\|^2
 = - \frac{| \langle x_2, y \rangle |^2}{\langle y, y \rangle}

 My Questions 
 I want to draw this to get a “better feeling of what is done in this proof”.
Let  $\mathcal{H} := \mathbb{R}^3$  and  $M :=  \text{span}((a,b,c))$  be a line. Then we have  $M^{\perp} = \{ (x,y,z): ax + by + cz = 0 \}$  is a plane.
Now let  $x = (u,v,w)$  be the arbitrary vector from the beginning the proof, which should not be in  $M$  or  $M^{\perp}$ , to avoid the trivial case  $x_1 = 0$  or  $x_2 = 0$ . 
 So:
How can I calculate  $K$  and  $x_2$ ?
And what is the geometric intuition of choosing  $\lambda$  that way?

"I am trying to understand confidence interval CI, from  simplest article  I could find about it. I got to an extent and then stuck at crucial moment. Suppose if we decide confidence level we want is 95%, then   
 
 95% of all ""95% Confidence Intervals"" will include the true mean. 
 
 This is usually many people infer wrong (assuming  a  confidence interval says that there is 95% chance that true mean lies within it). I could avoid this trap by focusing on above highlighted sentence. However, when I dig step by step, I get caught, how it could be the case.   
 
 Suppose I have a population distribution $Y$ with $\mu$ and $\sigma$. For brevity let it be already normal.   
 I take 1st sample set of size $n$, denoted by $n1$, described by random variable $X_1 = {x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_{n1}}$, samples picked from population. I find mean $\overline{X_1} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_{n1}}{n1}$ and variance $S_1$.  For a moment, lets say its normal. 
 Similary 2nd sample set of size $n$, denoted by $n2$, described by random variable $X_2 = {x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_{n2}}$, samples picked from population. I find mean $\overline{X_2} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_{n2}}{n2}$ and variance $S_2$.  Again we assume its normal. 
 
 I decide I want confidence level of 95%.   
 
 If I transfer my population distribution to Z standard deviation, then 95% area occurs at $Z= \pm 1.96$. Since $Z = \dfrac {Y-\mu}{\sigma}$, in original population distribution, 95% data points fall within $Y = \mu \pm 1.96\sigma$. 
$$
\color{blue}{\Pr(\mu-1.96\sigma < Y < \mu+1.96\sigma) = 0.95} \tag{1}
$$ 
 If I transfer my sample set n1 to Z standard (caz assuming its normal), again, 95% of $n1$ data points fall within $\overline{X_1} \pm 1.96S_1$
$$
\color{blue}{\Pr(\overline{X_1}-1.96S_1 < X_1 < \overline{X_1}+1.96S_1) = 0.95} \tag{2}
$$ 
 If I transfer my sample set $n2$ to Z standard, again, 95% of $n2$ data points fall within $\overline{X_2} \pm 1.96S_2$
$$
\color{blue}{\Pr(\overline{X_2}-1.96S_2 < X_2 < \overline{X_2}+1.96S_2) = 0.95} \tag{3}
$$ 
 Obviously, I would take many sample sets $n3,n4,n5, \cdots nk$ so my eventual sampling distribution of sample means, described by random variable $X$, would be normal, with mean $\overline{X} \rightarrow \mu$ and standard deviation, $S \rightarrow \dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
$$
\color{blue}{\Pr(\overline{X}-1.96S < X < \overline{X}+1.96S = 0.95}  \tag{4} 
$$
$$
\color{blue}{\Pr(\mu-1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} < X < \mu+1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}) = 0.95} \tag{5}
$$ 
 
 My questions: 
 
 Each sample set $n_k$ has its own interval derived from its mean $\overline{X_k}$ and variance $S_k$. How come when I take many of them, suddenly we would say, 95% of all those individual confidence intervals will contain true population mean $\mu$? What is the missing link here?Below is my derivation, is it correct and can we say because of that, it is thus proved, 95% CIs will have $\mu$?     
 
 From eq. $5$, 
$\Pr(\mu-1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} < X < \mu+1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}) = 0.95$   
 Adding $-\mu$ on both sides of inequalities,.. 
$\Pr(-\mu + \mu-1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} < -\mu + X < -\mu + \mu+1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}) = 0.95$ 
$\Pr(-1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} < X - \mu < 1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}) = 0.95$   
 Adding $-X$ on both sides of inequalities..
$\Pr(-X-1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} < -X+X - \mu < -X+1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}) = 0.95$ 
$\Pr(-X-1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} < - \mu < -X+1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}) = 0.95$   
 Multiplying by $-1$ on both sides of inequalities..
$\Pr(X+1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} > \mu > X-1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}) = 0.95$   
 This is same as,.. 
$$\color{blue}{
\Pr(X-1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} < \mu < X+1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}) = 0.95  \tag{6}
}
$$ 
 Eq. $6$ simply means, when we take enormous no of samples to arrive at sampling distribution of sample means described by $X$, probability of $\mu$ within intervals $X \pm 1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ is 95%. 
Also, 95% of sample mean values $\overline{X_k}$ values fall within this same interval $X \pm 1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. 
Because of this can we also say, the 95% of CIs associated with $\overline{X_k}$ also fall within this same interval $X \pm 1.96\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$? 
I think am also approaching with a narrowing missing link. Kindly help here.  
 
 Since there are many sample sets to be calculated to arrive at sampling distribution, do we divide by $n$ or $n-1$ (unbiased), for each sample set? (as they will influence CI calculation)  
 What happens to above questions, when I do not have normal distribution to start with for population ? (Instead say, random or uniform or bernoulli). The eventual sampling distribution might be normal, but we are talking about few sample sets in the beginning for which we calculate confidence intervals for. I ask this, because intermediate Z transformation I said earlier would not be possible, as those sample sets may not have normal distribution.

 Given a polynomial with real coefficients is there a method (e.g. from algebra or complex analysis) to calculate the number of complex zeros with a specified real part? 
 
 Background.  This question is motivated by my tests related to  this problem . 
 Let $p>3$ be a prime number. Let $G_p(x)=(x+1)^p-x^p-1$, and let
$$F_p(x)=\frac{(x+1)^p-x^p-1}{px(x+1)(x^2+x+1)^{n_p}}$$
where the exponent $n_p$ is equal to $1$ (resp. $2$) when $p\equiv-1\pmod 6$ (resp. $p\equiv1\pmod 6$). 
 The answer by Lord Shark the Unknown (loc. linked) implies that $F_p(x)$ is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. The degree of $F_p$ is equal to $6\lfloor(p-3)/6\rfloor$. I can show that the complex zeros of $F_p(x)$ come in groups of six. Each of the form $\alpha,-\alpha-1,1/\alpha,-1/(\alpha+1),-\alpha/(\alpha+1),-(\alpha+1)/\alpha.$ That is, orbits of a familiar group (isomorphic to $S_3$) of fractional linear transformations. 
 My conjecture.   Exactly one third of the zeros of $F_p(x)$ have real part equal to $-1/2$.   
 I tested this with Mathematica for a few of the smallest primes and it seems to hold. Also, each sextet of zeros of the above form seems to be stable under complex conjugation, and seems to contain a complex conjugate pair of numbers with real part $=-1/2$. 
Anyway, I am curious about the number of zeros $z=s+it$ of the polynomial $F_p(x)$ on the line $s=-1/2$. 
 Summary and thoughts. 
 
 Any general method or formula is welcome, but I will be extra grateful if you want to test a method on the polynomial $G_p(x)$ or $F_p(x)$ :-) 
 My first idea was to try the following: Given a polynomial $P(x)=\prod_i(x-z_i)$ is there a way of getting $R(x):=\prod_i(x-z_i-\overline{z_i})$? If this can be done, then we get the answer by calculating the multiplicity of $-1$ as a zero of $R(x)$. 
 May be a method for calculating the number of real zeros can be used with suitable substitution that maps the real axes to the line $s=-1/2$ (need to check on this)? 
 Of course, if you can prove that $F_p(x)$ is irreducible it is better that you post the answer to the linked question. The previous bounty expired, but that can be fixed.

"I am having a difficult time solving this problem. I have tried this several different ways, and I get a different result, none of which is correct, every time. I've derived an answer geometrically and cannot replicate it with a double integral. 
 Here's the problem: Use a double integral to find the area between two circles $$x^2+y^2=4$$ and $$(x−1)^2+y^2=4.$$ 
 Here is how I have tried to go about this problem: 
 First, I graphed it to get a good idea visually of what I was doing.
 Here's the graph I scribbled on. 
The region I'm interested is where these two circles overlap. This region can easily be divided into two separate areas. There are clearly a number of ways to go about solving this...but the one I opted for is to find the shaded region. The bounds for $x$ in this case are between $D$ and $C$. D can be found by setting $C_1=C_2$, and $x$ turns out to be $\frac{1}{2}$. On the right, $x$ is where $C_1(y)=0$, $x=\pm2$, so $x=2$ at point $C$. $y$ is greater than $B_y$ and less than $A_y$, which are also found where $C_1=C_2$, and $y$ turns out to be $\pm\sqrt{\frac{15}{4}}$. So far so good. Now I know my limits of integration. But here's what I don't understand. What am I actually integrating? $x$ has constant bounds, and $y$ does not, and looking at other double integral problems, that would lead me to believe that I should integrate $y$ first as a function of $x$, evaluate it at its bounds, and then integrate $x$ and evaluate it at its bounds giving me half the area I am looking for. However, when I try to do this, I get utter nonsense for an answer, or I get lost trying to set up the problem. 
 I could really use the help, I've spent entirely too much time trying to puzzle through this. Thank you in advance!

 $N$ is the smallest positive integer such that the sum of the digits of $N$ is 18 and the sum of the digits of $2N$ is $27$. Find $N$.  
 
 My workings so far: 
 If $N$ had two digits, then $N$ must equal $99$. However, the sum of the digits of $99\times 2$ does not equal $27$. Therefore, $N$ must have at least three digits.  
 Assume $N$ has three digits. Denote its digits by $a, b, c, \dots$ if their values are $0, 1, 2, 3,$ or $4$ $(a\neq 0$), and by $A, B, C, \dots$ if their values are $5, 6, 7, 8,$ or $9$.  
 The possibilities for $N$ are $abc, abC, aBc, Abc, ABc, AbC, aBC,$ or $ABC$. We can ignore the first four cases, as their maximum sum does not exceed 18. For the last four cases, 2N will respectively equal: 
 $[1][2A-9][2B-10][2c], [1][2A-10][2b+1][2C-10], [2a+1][2B-9][2C-10],$ and $[1][2A-0][2B-9][2C-10]$ 
 (where square brackets represent individual digits) 
 Given these numbers, based on the fact that $N$'s digits add to 18, the digit sums of the above cases are $18, 18, 18,$ and $9$ respectively. 
 Suppose $N$ is a four-digit number.... 
 
 I don't know how to continue from here. Maybe we could make a mock 'number' like above, but how would we calculate the digit sums of those cases?

"In his book  The Signal and the Noise , Nate Silver presents this example application of Bayes's Theorem on pp. 247-248: 
 
 Consider a somber example: the September 11 attacks. Most of us would
  have assigned almost no probability to terrorists crashing planes into
  buildings in Manhattan when we woke up that morning. But we recognized
  that a terror attack was an obvious possibility once the first plane hit
  the World Trade Center. And we had no doubt we were being attacked
  once the second tower was hit. Bayes's theorem can replicate this result. 
 
 You can view the complete example in Amazon.com's previw, and I've made the two pages available  here . 
 Silver assumes the prior probability of a terrorist plane attack to be 1 in 20,000. After the first plane crash, using Bayes's Theorem he updates that to 38%. And after the second plane crash, he comes up with a 99.99% probability. However, I think he may be mistaken. I'll provide the details below. 
 To be precise, let us define the following three events: 
 
 $PC$ = Plane Crash: At least one plane crashes into a Manhattan skyscraper on a given day.  
 $TPA$ = Terrorist Plane Attack: At least one plane is intentionally crashed into a Manhattan skyscraper on a given day. 
 $APC$ = Accidental Plane Crash: At least one plane is accidentally crashed into a Manhattan skyscraper on a given day. 
 
 We assume all plane crashes into buildings are either terrorist plane attacks or accidental (i.e. $PC = TPA \cup APC$). Using historical data, Silver estimates the prior probability of an accidental plane crash to be 1 in 12,500. In summary: $$P(TPA) = \frac{1}{20000},$$$$P(APC) = \frac{1}{12500}.$$ 
 Furthermore, Silver assumes $P(APC) = P(PC|\overline{TPA})$ (which is true if $APC$ and $TPA$ are independent events). 
 Applying Bayes's Theorem, he comes up with 
$$\begin{align}P(TPA|PC) &= \frac{P(PC|TPA) \times P(TPA)}{P(PC|TPA) \times P(TPA) + P(PC|\overline{TPA})(1-P(TPA))} \\
&= \frac{1 \times \frac{1}{20000}}{1 \times \frac{1}{20000} + 
\frac{1}{12500} \times (1 - \frac{1}{20000})} = 0.385\end{align}$$ 
 Silver continues: 
 
 The idea behind Bayes's theorem, however, is not that we update our 
  probability estimates just once. Instead, we do so continuously as new
  evidence presents itself to us. Thus our posterior probability of a
  terror attack after the first plane hit, 38 percent, becomes our
   prior  probability before the second one did. And if you go through the calculation again, to  reflect the second plane hitting the World
  Trade Center, the probability that we were under attack becomes a
  near-certainty -- 99.99 percent. 
 
 That is (this is Silver's calculation): $$P(TPA|PC) = \frac{1 \times 0.385}{1 \times 0.385 + 
\frac{1}{12500}(1-0.385)} = 99.99 \%$$ 
 ""Cool!"" I thought, until I thought a bit more. The problem is that you can apply the same logic to calculate the conditional probability of an  accidental  crash, too. I'll spare you the math, but I come up with $P(APC|PC) = 0.615$ after the first crash, and $P(APC|PC) = 99.997\%$ after the second. 
 So we can be almost certain the second plane crash is a terrorist attack, and we can be even more certain that it's accidental?   
 I think the problem is that when Silver applies Bayes's Theorem after the second crash, he uses the updated probability of a terrorist plane attack as his prior, but fails to update the prior probability of an accidental plane crash (which should become 0.615). After the second crash, then, the correct formula is
$$P(TPA|PC) = \frac{1 \times 0.385}{1 \times 0.385 + 
0.615(1-0.385)} = 0.504$$ 
 Similarly, the probability that we're observing an accidental crash given that there have been two crashes is 
$$P(APC|PC) = \frac{1 \times 0.615}{1 \times 0.615 + 
0.385(1-0.615)} = 0.806$$

 Step $(1):$ Begin with one cup of coffee 
 Step $(2):$ Wait until he begins to feel drowsy (occurs when caffeine level drops to $12mg$), then drink another cup of coffee. Wait until he feels drowsy again, (that is , his caffeine  level falls to $12mg$), then drink another cup; and so on.  
 $(i)$ How many cups of coffee will he drink during the night? 
 $(ii)$ What will his caffeine level be when he finishes the chapter? 
 
 
 The only progress I have gotten on this part of the question is that when $C=12mg$ then $t=\frac{-\ln(0.6)}{0.6} \approx 0.85 hrs$ but not sure how to continue this because at that time $0.85$ hrs that is when his caffeine level is at 12mg do I just divide 10 hrs by this and calculate the cups of coffee or is ther more to it.. I am stuck on how to answer part(i) and (ii)...

We have to calculate the surface area from $x=1$ to $x=a$ where $a$ is a real number bigger than one. I cannot manage to work it out myself so I have had a search around and found a few examples of how it is calculated from $x=1$ to $x=\infty$. Here is the working to one: 
 $$SA = \int_1^\infty 2\pi y \sqrt{1+(y')^2}\ dx >2\pi\int_1^\infty ydx$$
$$=2\pi \int_1^\infty dx/x $$
$$=2\pi [\ln x]_1^\infty$$

$$=\infty$$

"I'm parallel transporting a vector along a curve and trying to calculate how much this vector rotates relative to the curve's tangent vector.  So if the path is a geodesic then I will get an answer of zero.   
 I have looked at paths that are not geodesics and calculated the end form of the vector.  I now want to compare it to its original form. 
 My textbooks says that if two vectors ($\Bbb{X},\Bbb{Y}$) are at the same point then the angle between them is: 
 $\cos(\theta)=\frac{<\Bbb{X},\Bbb{Y}>}{|\Bbb{X}|\cdot |\Bbb{Y}|}$ 
 I was wondering if I'm allowed to do this if the vectors are not at the same point i.e. I want to compare the starting vector to its end form even though they are at different places. 
 My thoughts: intuitively it makes sense that this is possible.  Between the vector's start and end points there is a geodesic.  I could parallel transport the vector to the end point via this geodesic.  The angle of my vector to the geodesic's tangent will be preserved.  Now I could compare this vector to the vector obtained via the non-geodesic path.  Would this give me the same answer as if I just used the above formula?  Thanks!

"I hope everyone is off to a good star of the new year! 
 So I'm trying to figure out a way of calculate how far I'm able to fly my drone without losing visual sight of it when having an obstacle (a forest for example, but a house or hill or similar would also be applicable) between me and the drone. This would be helpful when planning the flight and choosing a take off site. 
 The problem:
Where I live we have lots of forests. There are clearings in the forests of different sizes however and I want to launch and control my drone from inside of these clearings. The problem is that I need to keep a clear visual line of sight (VLOS) to the drone, the reason for this is twofold: It's the law and the drone will lose its connection eventually if the obstacle is removing enough signal strength. Without knowing how far I'm able to fly the drone in VLOS while planning the mission I risk not being able to cover the planned area. So  I need to be able to calculate the possible flight distance during planning  and i figured simple trigonometry would be a logic way of doing that. 
 The solution:
Calculating the flight distance using simple trigonometry, using the Pythagorean theorem and Tangents, Sines, and Cosines. 
 How:
The illustration below shows the problem. The line i call VLOS need to be clear of any obstacle, in this case, trees. I want to know the maximum flight distance before the VLOS line hits a tree. 
 Assuming I know the height of the obstacle and the distance between it and where I will be standing with the remote, and also the altitude of the drone, I should be able to calculate the flying distance without losing VLOS. 
 As you see in this illustration I made ( Flight distance illustration ) if the drone goes any further the VLOS will hit the trees and thus making it impossible to see, and also weakening the signal. Assuming I'm already at maximum height (120 m) I'm unable to increase the altitude. 
 In this illustration ( Flight distance illustration with values ) I have changed the names of the lines to a,b,c etc. I have also made another triangle consisting of the distance between the RC and the bottom of the tree (b1), the height of the tree (a1) and the distance between the RC and the top of the tree. (c1). 
 Here are the values i will use: 
 a1= 36,7m 
 b1= 33m 
 c1= ? 
 a2= 120m 
 b2= ? (what I'm after) 
 c2= ? 
 v= ? 
 To start I would use the pythagorean theorem to get the length of c1 (distance between RC and treetop): 
 √(a1^2+b1^2)= c1 
 √36,7^2+33^2= 49,35m 
 The next step then would be to calculate the angle of v using arccos (degrees) 
 arccos(b1/c1)=v 
 arccos(33/49,35)=48,03° 
 Now the last step is to get the flight distance (b2) using Tangents 
 a2/Tan(v)=b2 
 120/Tan(48,03)=107m 
 So the maximum flight distance (while still being able to unhindered see the drone) is calculated to be 107m, however I have tried this exact scenario and the flight distance was instead 172m. Why is that? 
 The weaknesses that I have found to this method is: 
 
 My math. To put i simply I'm not very good at math and I could have easily made a mistake in my equations. 
 
 Using the wrong value for a1. This the easiest error to make here, since I don't have the exact height of the trees. Accuracy depending on method used for measuring the height. (in my case a tree height measuring application) 
 
 Using the wrong value for b1. Also easy to make. Depends on method used to measure. (in my case I measured in QGIS on satellite imagery) 
 
 
 Note: The drone doesn't change its altitude and it is relative to where the RC is, so the terrain under the drone doesn't affect the result of a2, it is constant) 
 If I change a1 and b1 to be -5m and +5m (a1=31,7 and b1=38) I still only get 148 m of flight distance. I find it rather unlikely that I would be that much off on both of these values. 
 While I was out doing this test I was also able to make a test where a1=26,7m and b1=94m. The result using the same calculation as above is 422 m  flight distance (or b2). The real result however was 843 m of flight distance! 
 So what is going on here? Why is the calculated flight distance much lower than the real flight distance?

"I have two similar problems that I have tried to solve for several hours now but I end up with wrong answers. So there is something I do not understand correctly. 
 Problem 1 :
The intersection between the ellipsoid and the plane
 $$2 x^2 + y^2 + z^2=4$$ 
 $$x-y+2z=2$$ 
is an ellipsoid in the room.
Calculate the tangent direction at the point  $$(1,1,1)$$ 
 Attempted solution 1  (wrong): 
 1) Check that the point satisfies both equations ( ok )
 $2*1^2+1^2+1^2 = 4$  and  $1-1+2*1=2$ 
 2) To find the intersection setup both equations as:
 $2x^2+y^2+z^2-4=x-y+2z-2$ 
 3) We can then write the equation as:
 $$g(\mathbf x)=2x^2-x+y^2+y+z^2-2z-2 = 0$$ 
 $$g(\mathbf x)=2(x-\frac{1}{4})^2-2(\frac{1}{4})^2+(y+\frac{1}{2})^2-(\frac{1}{2})^2+(z-1)^2-1^2-2 = 0$$ 
 $$g(\mathbf x)=2(x-\frac{1}{4})^2+(y+\frac{1}{2})^2+(z-1)^2 = \frac{19}{8}$$ 
4) The normal of this new ellipsoid will be:
 $$\nabla g(\mathbf x) = (4x-1, 2y+1, 2z-2)$$ 
The tangent equation is:
 $$\nabla g(\mathbf a)\cdot(\mathbf x - \mathbf a)=0$$ 
5) My ""answer""
 $$\mathbf a = (1,1,1)$$ 
 $$(3, 3, 0)\cdot(x-1, y-1, z-1) = 0$$ 
 $$(x-1) + (y-1) = 0$$ 
But this is not a direction! 
 Correct answer to problem 1: 
 $$(-1,1,1)$$ 
 Problem 2 :
The intersection between the hyperbola and the plane
 $$x^2+y^2-z^2=1$$ 
 $$x-y+z=3$$ 
goes along a curve  $\gamma$ .
Calculate the equation for the tangent at the point  $$(2,1,2)$$ 
 Attmpted solution 2 (wrong): 
 I use the same method as in problem 1 and I get a plane for the tangent. But it is a line in the answer.
I do not understand how to get to this solution :-( 
 Correct answer to problem 2 
 $$(x,y,z)=(2,1,2) + t(1,4,3)$$

 If I want to calculate the sum  
 ${n \choose 0}+{n \choose 1}x+{n \choose 2}x^2+...+{n \choose n-1}x^{n-1}+{n \choose n}x^n$,    (1) 
 where $n$ is a natural number, I can effectively use the binomial theorem to see that the sum equals $(x+1)^n$. I can also give a combinatorial explanation for it which indeed is one way to prove the aforementioned theorem.  
 Many basic ""standard exercises"" ask me to calculate sums on this form with different values of $x$ and in these cases I have just applied the binomial theorem and quickly got an satisfying answer. But after some reflections it now feels like I´m ""attacking"" the problems from behind, with the proviso that I knew the sum took the form of a binomial expansion. Maybe this is a tool in problem solving? As an example: 
 For $x=10$ in the sum (1). I would see that $x=10$ just got substituted into the binomial expansion of $(x+1)^n$ and so the answer would be $11^n$. 
 But is there any other ""easy"" way to see that the result of (1). is $(x+1)^n$
without starting out with just recognizing the form of the sum? Let´s say I didn´t recognize that it was the binomial expansion of $(x+1)^n$ at first, how would I convince myself that´s clearly the case? Is there maybe some nice combinatorial explanations to attack the problem from this way also?

with  $n \geq 2$  be a ring homomorphism with  $f(1) = I_n, f(X) = M$ . 
 a) Prove it is never injective and never surjective. 
 b) Find the minimal polynomial and the amount of elements  $ \operatorname{Im}(f)$  with  $p=3, n=6$  and with  $M$  given:
 $f(X)= M  = \left( \begin{matrix} 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right).$ 
 
 a) I first proved that  $f$  is fully determined by  $f(X)$ .
 $f(p(X)) = f(\sum_{i=1}^n a_iX^i) = \sum_{i=1}^n f(a_i)f(X^i) =  \sum_{i=1}^n a_if(X)^i$ , so we see that indeed  $f$  is determined by the value of  $f(X)$ . (These operations are allowed since  $f$  is a ring homomorphism). 
 Then I tried proving that it is never injective.
Since  $M \in \mathbb{Z}_p^{n \times n}$ , I know that there exists a  $q \in \mathbb{N}$  such that  $M^q = 0$  with  $q$  a divisor of  $p$ .
Consider  $p(X) = X^i$ , then  $f(p(X)) = p(f(X)) = p(0) = 0$ , which means that  $p(X) \in \text{ker}(f)$  and since the kernel is not equal to  $\{0\}$  we know it is not injective. 
 I am not sure how to prove that it is never surjective. 
 b) I think that the minimal polynomial is equal to  $\phi_M(X) = (X-2)^2(X-1)$  since there are 2 Jordan blocks for eigenvalue 2 and 1 for eigenvalue 1.

"I know the chain rule for derivatives. The way as I apply it, is to get rid of specific 'bits' of a complex equation in stages, i.e I will derive the $5$th root first in the equation $(2x+3)^5$ and continue with the rest. 
 I wonder if there is something similar with integration. I tried to integrate that way $(2x+3)^5$ but it doesn't seem to work. Well, it works in the first stage, i.e it's fine to raise in the power of $6$ and divide with $6$ to get rid of the power $5$, but afterwards, if we would apply the chain rule, we should multiply by the integral of $2x+3$!, But it doesn't work like that, we just need to multiply by $1/2$ and that's it. 
 So my question is, is there chain rule for integrals? I want to be able to calculate integrals of complex equations as easy as I do with chain rule for derivatives.

"I am not very sophisticated in my linear algebra, so please excuse any messiness in my terminology, etc. 
 I am attempting to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset using Singular Value Decomposition, and I am having a little trouble figuring out how this should be done.  I have found a lot of material about reducing the rank of a matrix, but not reducing its dimensions. 
 For instance, if I decompose using SVD: $A = USV^T$, I can reduce the rank of the matrix by eliminating singular values below a certain threshold and their corresponding vectors.  However, doing this returns a matrix of the same dimensions of $A$, albeit of a lower rank. 
 What I actually want is to be able to express all of the rows of the matrix in terms of the top principal components (so an original 100x80 matrix becomes a 100x5 matrix, for example).  This way, when I calculate distance measures between rows (cosine similarity, Euclidean distance), the distances will be in this reduced dimension space. 
 My initial take is to multiply the original data by the singular vectors: $AV_k$.  Since $V$ represents the row space of $A$, I interpret this as projecting the original data into a subspace of the first $k$ singular vectors of the SVD, which I believe is what I want. 
 Am I off base here?  Any suggestions on how to approach this problem differently?

 A family has two children. Let C be a characteristic that a child can have, and assume
that each child has characteristic C with probability p, independently of each other and
of gender. For example, C could be the characteristic “born in winter”. Show that the probability that both children are girls given that at least one
is a girl with characteristic C is  $(2−p)/(4−p)$ 
, which is 1/3 if  $p = 1$  and approaches 1/2 from below as  $p \to 0$  (agreeing with Example 2.2.7). 
 
 Can somebody correct my wrong attempt below? 
 Define  $2G$  =""Both are Girls"",  $A$  = ""at least one girl"". 
 $P(C)=p$ , since C is independent from gender and each other. Then  $P(C|A)=P(C)=p$ . 
 I need to find  $P(2G|A,C)=P(2G$  and  $A$  and  $C)/P(A$  and  $C)$ . I tried to calculate  $P(A$  and  $C)=P(C$  and  $A)=P(C|A)P(A)$ . 
 $P(A)=1/3, P(C|A)=p \implies P(C$  and  $A)=p/3=P(L)$ . 
 I define  $L = C \cap A$  to simplify  notation. Then 
 $P(2G|A,C)=P(2G|L)=P(2G$  and  $L)/P(L)=P(L|2G)P(2G)/P(L)$ . 
 In my new notation,  $P(L|2G)$  is the probability that ""at least one girl has C"" given that both are girls. I tried to calculate   $P(L|2G)$   based on common sense, by dividing it into two cases where: 
 
 $P($ one  $C|2G)$ . Thus, only one of them has C  $\implies$   $P($ one  $C|2G)$ =first has & second not + first not & second has  $= pq+qp=\color{limegreen}{2pq}$ , where  $q=1-p$ . 
 
 $P($ both have  $C|2G)$ . Since C is independent from gender and each other, then  $P($ both have  $C|2G)=\color{red}{pp}$ . 
 
 
 Hence,  $P(L|2G)=\color{limegreen}{2pq}+\color{red}{pp}=2p(1-p)$ . 
 I think  $P(2G) = 1/4$ , since there are only 4 choices:  BB,  GG, GB, BG. 
 I concluded  $P(2G|L)=\dfrac{2p(1-p)\times 1/4}{p/3}=\dfrac{3(1-p)}{2}$ . But this is certainly wrong.

 I prove the exactness of $H^k(C)$: 
 First I prove that $im( j^*)\subseteq ker (d^*)$.  Let $[b]\in H^k(B) $ then $d^* j^* [b] = d^*[j(b)]$. 
In the recipe above for $d^*$ , we can choose the element in $B^k$ that maps to $j(b)$ to be b. Then $db \in B^{k+1}$. Because b is a cocycle, $db=0$. Following the Zig-Zag diagram we see that since $i(0) = 0 = db$, we must have 
$d^*[j(b)] = [0]$, so $j^*[b]\in ker(d^*)$.  The other way, i.e.,
$ker(d^*) \subseteq im(j^*)$:  suppose $d^*[c] = [a]=0$, where 
$[c] \in H^k(C) $, this means that $a=da´$ for some $ a´ \in A^k$.i calculate the $d^*$ again by the diagram and take an element $ b \in B^k$with $j(b) = c$ and $i(a) = db$. Then $b - i(a´)$ is a cocycle in $B^k$ that maps to c under j: 
 $d(b - i(a´)) = db-di(a´) = db - id(a´) = db - ia = 0$,
$j(b - i(a´)) = db-ji(a´) = j(b) = c$

The problem I am facing with this is (besides my amateurish knowledge of probability theory): Consider one draw contains three hearts, and all other draws do not. Then, the previously mentioned probability would not be correct, since we cannot obtain three hearts.

"My task is as in the topic, I've given function $$f(x)=\frac{1}{1+x+x^2+x^3}$$
My solution is following (when $|x|<1$):$$\frac{1}{1+x+x^2+x^3}=\frac{1}{(x+1)+(x^2+1)}=\frac{1}{1-(-x)}\cdot\frac{1}{1-(-x^2)}=$$$$=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-x)^k\cdot \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-x^2)^k$$ Now I try to calculate it the following way: 
 \begin{align}
& {}\qquad \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-x)^k\cdot \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-x^2)^k \\[8pt]
& =(-x+x^2-x^3+x^4-x^5+x^6-x^7+x^8-x^9+\cdots)\cdot(-x^2+x^4-x^6+x^8-x^{10}+\cdots) \\[8pt]

"What's the math formula that is used to calculate maximum mortgage amount like in this  calculator ? 
 Visual Reference : Take a look at these images to see which tool I'm specifically referring to: 
 Purchase Budget with  $0\%$  Interest 
 Purchase Budget with  $1\%$  Interest 
 Situation : Right now I can calculate everything correctly while the interest rate is set at  $0\%$ . I'm having difficulty deriving the formula that takes into account the interest rate and how it impacts the Mortgage Amount/Purchase Budget. 
 The calculator I linked to has the Debt-to-Income Ratio set to  $0.36$ , so in my example images, a  $\$10,000$  yearly income equates to  $\$300,000$  in  $30$  years, and  $36\%$  of that  $\$108,000$ , which you can see in the first image with  $0\%$  interest set. 
 All the other fields have a linear correlation to how much they affect the Mortgage Amount/Purchase Budget. For example, a  $\$1$  monthly debt would result in a  $\$360$  reduction of the budget ( $\$1 \times 12$  months  $\times 30$ -year term). 
 Attempts :I tried seeing if the correlation was with the Mortgage Amortization, but it doesn't appear so from what I've tried. 
 Context & Motivation : I'm building my own personal finance/budgeting tool so that I can have every financial calculation in one place rather than utilizing various tools spread across various sites. An additional motivation is that the knowledge and understanding I gain from working on this can help someone else too. 
 Update : I solved this shortly after posting the question and posted my answer below. I see that someone else also provided a solution that can work too, but the one I posted fit better with my personal project.

"I need to study the convergence of the series  $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\arctan(\frac{2x}{x^2+n^4})$ . 
 I thought about 2 ways it can be done. 
 One way is to try and calculate the partial sum of the series so we can see what is its limit.  
 Another way is to use the fact that if we have  $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f_n(x)$  and we find a sequence  $a_n$  so that  
 $|f_n(x)| \leq a_n$   
 and 
 $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$  is convergent 
 then  $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f_n(x)$  is convergent. 
 Now, we know that  $arctan : \mathbb{R} -> (-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$  but if we take  $a_n = \frac{\pi}{2}$  then  $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$  is divergent, but maybe there is a sequence that is bigger than  $|arctan(\frac{2x}{x^2+n^4})|$  but it is convergent. 
 Can you help me out to see how to study the convergence of this function series?

 Here we go... 
 y = 3t(5t + 4)^5

ln(y) = ln(3t(5t + 4)^5)

ln(y) = 5*ln(3t(5t + 4))

d/dt(ln(y)) = d/dt(5*ln(3t(5t + 4)))

d/dt(ln(y)) = d/dt(5)*d/dt(ln(3t(5t + 4)))

d/dt(ln(y)) = d/dt(ln(3t(5t + 4)))

d/dt(ln(y)) = 1/(3t(5t + 4)) *d/dt(3t(5t + 4))

d/dt(ln(y))*(3t(5t + 4)) = d/dt(3t(5t + 4))

d/dt(ln(y))*(3t(5t + 4)) = d/dt(15t^2 + 12t)

d/dt(ln(y))*(3t(5t + 4)) = d/dt(15t^2) + d/dt(12t)

d/dt(ln(y))*(3t(5t + 4)) = 15*d/dt(t^2) + 12*dt/dt(t)

d/dt(ln(y))*(3t(5t + 4)) = 15*d/dt(t^2) + 12

d/dt(ln(y))*(3t(5t + 4)) = 15*2t*dt/dt + 12

d/dt(ln(y))*(3t(5t + 4)) = 15*2t + 12

d/dt(ln(y))*(3t(5t + 4)) = 30t + 12

d/dt(ln(y)) = (30t + 12)/(3t(5t + 4))

1/y*d/dt = (30t + 12)/(3t(5t + 4))

d/dt = y*(30t + 12)/(3t(5t + 4))

d/dt = 3t(5t + 4)^5 *(30t + 12)/(3t(5t + 4))

d/dt = (5t + 4)^4 *(30t + 12)

d/dt = [6(5t + 4)^4 *(5t + 2)]
 
 Wolfram: 
 d/dt = 6(5t + 4)^4 *(15t + 2)
 
 Amended approach as per nbubis: 
 The log method was presented as an easy way to handle complex exponents. So I adopted it for all exponent handling. 
 y = 3t(5t + 4)^5

d/dt(y) = d/dt(3t(5t + 4)^5)

F(t) = f(t)*g(h(t))

f(t) = 3t

f'(t) = 3

g(t) = (t)^5

g'(t) = 5(t)^4

h(t) = 5t + 4

h'(t) = 5

F'(t) = f'(t)*g(h(t)) + f(t)*g'(h(t))

F'(t) = f'(t)*g(h(t)) + f(t)*g'(h(t))*h'(t)

F'(t) = 3*(5t + 4)^5 + 3t*5(5t + 4)^4*5

F'(t) = 3*(5t + 4)^5 + 75t(5t + 4)^4
 
 How did you remove ^5? 
 Duh, common factor!!! 
 F'(t) = (3*(5t + 4) + 75t)(5t + 4)^4

F'(t) = 3(5t + 4 + 25t)(5t + 4)^4

F'(t) = 3(30t + 4)(5t + 4)^4

F'(t) = 3*2(15t + 2)(5t + 4)^4

F'(t) = [6(15t + 2)(5t + 4)^4]
 
 Thanks! 
 And now for the complete log method: 
 y = 3t(5t + 4)^5

ln(y) = ln(3t(5t + 4)^5)

ln(y) = ln(3) + ln(t) + ln((5t + 4)^5)

ln(y) = ln(3) + ln(t) + 5*ln(5t + 4)

d/dt(ln(y)) = d/dt(ln(3)) + d/dt(ln(t)) + d/dt(5*ln(5t + 4))

d/dt(ln(y)) = 1/3*d/dt(3) + 1/t*d/dt(t) + 5*d/dt(ln(5t + 4))

d/dt(ln(y)) = 1/3*d/dt(3) + 1/t*d/dt(t) + 5/(5t + 4)*d/dt(5t + 4)

d/dt(ln(y)) = 1/3*d/dt(3) + 1/t*d/dt(t) + 5/(5t + 4)*(d/dt(5t) + d/dt(4))

d/dt(ln(y)) = 1/3*d/dt(3) + 1/t*d/dt(t) + 5/(5t + 4)*(d/dt(5t) + 0)

d/dt(ln(y)) = 1/3*d/dt(3) + 1/t*d/dt(t) + 5/(5t + 4)*(d/dt(5t))

d/dt(ln(y)) = 1/3*d/dt(3) + 1/t*d/dt(t) + 5/(5t + 4)*(5*dt/dt)

d/dt(ln(y)) = 1/3*d/dt(3) + 1/t*d/dt(t) + 5/(5t + 4)*(5)

d/dt(ln(y)) = 1/3*d/dt(3) + 1/t*d/dt(t) + 25/(5t + 4)

d/dt(ln(y)) = 1/3*d/dt(3) + 1/t*dt/dt + 25/(5t + 4)

d/dt(ln(y)) = 1/3*d/dt(3) + 1/t + 25/(5t + 4)

d/dt(ln(y))3 = d/dt(3) + 3/t + 3*25/(5t + 4)

d/dt(ln(y))3 = 0 + 3/t + 75/(5t + 4)

d/dt(ln(y))3 = 3/t + 75/(5t + 4)

d/dt(ln(y))3t = 3 + 75t/(5t + 4)

d/dt(ln(y))3t(5t + 4) = 3(5t + 4) + 75t

d/dt(ln(y)) = (3(5t + 4) + 75t)/3t(5t + 4)

1/y*dy/dt = (3(5t + 4) + 75t)/3t(5t + 4)

dy/dt = y(3(5t + 4) + 75t)/3t(5t + 4)

dy/dt = 3t(5t + 4)^5 *(3(5t + 4) + 75t)/3t(5t + 4)

dy/dt = (5t + 4)^4 *(3(5t + 4) + 75t)

dy/dt = (5t + 4)^4 *(15t + 12 + 75t)

dy/dt = (5t + 4)^4 *(90t + 12)

dy/dt = [6(5t + 4)^4 *(15t + 2)]!!!

 $$A=20\ddot s_{\overline{6} \rceil.10}$$ 
 B), He also deposits $X$ for three years so that his last $X$ coincides with his last $20$ deposit, this accumulated value is also an annuity due, so  
 $$B=X\ddot s_{\overline{3} \rceil.10}$$ 
 C), If the present value of the item is $200$ and the price inflates $4\%$ each year until year $10$, the future value is simply 
 $$C=200(1.04)^{10}$$ 
 From here I solved for $X$ using the equation $$(A+B)(1.04)^3=C$$ resulting in $X\approx 25$, but the answer is supposedly $\approx 8.92$. 
 I appreciate your help.

"Let $M \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ given by
\begin{align}
M:= \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : z=xy, x^2 + y^2 <1 \}

Calculate the area of the submanifold $M$. 
 The solution says: 
 $M$ is a submanifold, since it is the graph of the continuously differentiable function $f(x,y):= xy$ defined on the open set $U:= B(0,1)$. From this, we get immediately a local parametrization $\phi(x,y):= (x, y, xy)$ which extends to a map $\phi: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$, defining a 2-dimensional submanifold $N \subset \mathbb{R}^3$. The 2-Jacobian of $\phi$ is given by 
\begin{align}
J_2(d\phi) = \sqrt{1 + |\nabla f|^2} = \sqrt{1 + y^2 + x^2}
\end{align}
The area of $M$ is defined as
\begin{align}
Area(M) := \text{sup} \Bigg\{ \int_M f \, \, d\text{vol}_2 : f \in \mathscr{C}^0_{c}(M, [0, 1]) \Bigg\}

 We have some trouble to understand the following part of the solution: 
 \begin{align}

"The basic problem is this: ""I have this number x and I ask you to give me another number y. If the number you give me is some percentage c different than my number then I do not want it."" Given that you will know x and c, how do you calculate whether or not I should take y? 
 The naive approach I came up with is to just divide y / x < c but this fails for obvious reason (try y bigger than x). 
 The next approach I is that the percentage difference is really just a ratio of the smaller number divided by the larger number. So thereforce we could try min(x, y) / max(x, y) < c. However this does not work, here is an example: 
 x = 1.2129 y = 1.81935 c = 50% 
 If we do the above we get 1.2129 / 1.81935 = 0.67 which is greater than 0.50. The problem here is that I obtained y by multiplying 1.2129 by 1.5, therefore y is only 50% greater than x. Why? I still don't understand why the above formula doesn't work. 
 Eventually through some googling I stumbled accross the percentage difference formula but even this doesn't suit my needs. It is abs(x - y) / ((x + y) / 2). However, this does not yield the result I am looking for. abs(x - y) = abs(1.2129 - 1.81935 ) = 0.60645. (x + y) / 2 = 3.03225 / 2 = 1.516125 0.60645 / 1.516125 = 0.4 
 Eventually I ended up writing some code to evaluate x * c < y < x * (1 + c). As the basic idea is that we don't want any y that is 50% less than my number, nor do we want any number that is 50% greater than my number. 
 Could someone please help me identify what I'm missing here? It seems like there ought to be another way that you can calculate the percentage difference of two arbitrary numbers and then compare it to c.

"I am solving a problem about T9 Keyboard and knight movement:  
 We have found a device which have a classic keyboard like below.

|1|2|3|
|4|5|6|
|7|8|9|
|*|0|#|

This device is protected by a secret password. We don't know what the password is,
but after several hours of reversing we know that the password was generated by
following the rules:
1, The password has length of n, and contains characters as shown on the keyboard.
2, The password must end with either *, 8 or #.
3, After one character, the character which is on the knight move pattern (as the
knight in chess) can be the next character. For example, if the current character
is 3, then the next character can be either 4 or 8.

We really want to know how many passwords can be generated given length n, so that
we can know whether to give up brute-force or not. Ah, because that number may be
very large so you just need to give us the answer modulo 1e39.
 
 These are something I calculated: 
 We can create password from the last character, which are *, # and 8.
nAsterisk(x), nSharp(x), nEight(x) will be the number of possible x-length passwords

"I am trying to calculate the area of union of n circles in a plane when it is known that all circles are of equal radii and their centers are also known(of all n circles). I was trying to follow the set theory approach(inclusion-exclusion principle), where we know the formula for union of n sets. I was just using an operator Ar() which gives the area,i.e. Ar(A) gives me the area of A. I first tried to find out which circle is intersecting with which other circle(s) with the help of D<2R(D=dist between the centers of the two circles), then I was trying to calculate the area of intersection between them pairwise and hence find the area of union. But I am getting stuck for n>4. Can anyone provide a soln to this(soln by the set theory approach is necessary). Thanks in advance

"So I'm a bit confused with calculating a double integral when a circle isn't centered on $(0,0)$.  
 For example: Calculating $\iint(x+4y)\,dx\,dy$ of the area $D: x^2-6x+y^2-4y\le12$. 
So I kind of understand how to center the circle and solve this with polar coordinates. Since the circle equation is $(x-3)^2+(y-2)^2=25$, I can translate it to $(u+3)^2+(v+2)^2=25$ and go on from there. 
 However I would like to know if I could solve this without translating the circle to the origin. I thought I could, so I simply tried solving $\iint(x+4y)\,dx\,dy$ by doing this:
$\int_0^{2\pi}\,d\phi\int_0^5(r\cos\phi + 4r\sin\phi)r\,dr$ but this doesn't work. I'm sure I'm missing something, but why should it be different? the radius is between 0 and 5 in the original circle as well, etc. 
 So my questions are: 
 
 How can I calculate something like the above integral without translating the circle to the origin? What am I doing wrong? 
 I would appreciate a good explanation of what are the steps exactly when translating the circle. I kind of ""winged it"" with just saying ""OK, I have to move the $X$ back by 3, so I'll call it $X+3$, the same with the $Y$ etc. If someone could give a clear breakdown of the steps that would be very nice :)

"We denote for integers $n\geq 1$ the $nth$ prime number as $p_n$. And for integers $k\geq 1$, I consider this recurrence relation
$$a_{k+1}=\frac{a_k}{p_{k+1}}+\frac{1}{a_k},\tag{1}$$ with $a_1$ defined to be equal to $1$. 
 I've calculated some (few) terms of this sequence $a_k$. See here the first  examples. 
 Examples of computations of some terms of our sequence $ \left\{ a_n\right\}_{n=1} ^\infty$:   
 1) Since $a_1=1$ then $a_2=\frac{a_1}{p_2}+(a_1)^{-1}=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{1}=\frac{4}{3}$.  
 2) Since the third prime number is $p_3=5$ one has  $$a_3=\frac{a_2}{p_3}+\frac{1}{a_2}=\frac{4/3}{5}+\frac{3}{4}=\frac{61}{60}.$$ 
3) Similarly $a_4=\frac{61}{7\cdot 60}+(60/61)^{-1}\approx 1.1288$. $\square$ 
 Thus our sequence starts as $a_1=1,a_2\approx 1.3333, a_3\approx 1.0117, a_4\approx 1.1288$ and similarly we can calculate $a_5\approx 0.9664,a_6\approx 1.1091$ or $a_7\approx 0.9669$. 
 To create this problem I was inspired in a recurrence that $\sqrt{2}$ solves as you can see from this  WIkipedia , and now I am curious about how to check that the sequence in $(1)$ is convergent.

 Also let  $r > 0 $ ,  $r' = \frac{r}{r-1}$ , such that  $\frac{N}{2}(1 - \frac{1}{r}) + \frac{1}{2} < 1$ . 
 We wish to prove the following integral equation: 
 $ \displaystyle \int^{t}_{0} \large (t-s)^{ -\frac{N}{2}(1 - \frac{1}{r}) - \frac{1}{2} } (t+s)^{ - \frac{N}{2} (q - \frac{1}{r'}) } \text{d}s = \large C t^{  \frac{1}{2} - \frac{N}{2} q } $ , 
 where  $C > 0$  is a constant, possibly just  $1$ . 
 I'm afraid I do not even know where to begin with this monster. Integral calculators have not been of much help. I presume it is a key point that  $\frac{N}{2}(1 - \frac{1}{r}) + \frac{1}{2} < 1$ , as the negative of this figure appears as the exponent of  $(t-s)$ . 
 Any hints/suggestions as to how I can calculate this integral are much appreciated. 
 EDIT 
 After substituting  $s = tx$ , we arrive at the integral: 
 $ \large t^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{N}{2}q }  \int^{1}_{0} (1-x)^{-\frac{N}{2} (1 - \frac{1}{r}) - \frac{1}{2} } (1+x)^{ -\frac{N}{2} (q - \frac{1}{r'}) } \text{d}x $ . 
 Thus, it remains only to show that  
 $\int^{1}_{0} (1-x)^{-\frac{N}{2} (1 - \frac{1}{r}) - \frac{1}{2} } (1+x)^{ -\frac{N}{2} (q - \frac{1}{r'}) } \text{d}x = C$ . 
 From our setting of  $r$ , as explained above, we have the following bounds on each of the exponents, which seem to be important for the existence of this integeral: 
 $ \large -1 < -\frac{N}{2} (1 - \frac{1}{r}) - \frac{1}{2} < 0 $ 
 $ \large -\frac{1}{2} -\frac{N}{2}q < -\frac{N}{2} (q - \frac{1}{r'})  < \frac{1}{2} -\frac{N}{2}q  $ 
 In particular, by our definition of  $q$ , both exponents are always negative.

"The series : $$\lim\limits_{n \to  \infty }  \sum\limits_{k=1}^n - (-1)^{k} \ln (k)$$ 
 We know that, for a sum $\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ to  converge , a  necessary  condition is that : 
$$\lim_{k\to\infty} a_k = 0$$
We can write the above series as 
$$\ln(1)-\ln(2)+\ln(3)-\ln(4)+\ln(5)-\ln(6)\cdots\infty$$
It becomes : \begin{align}
& =\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \ln\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) + \ln\left(\frac{5}{6}\right) + \ln\left(\frac{7}{8}\right) + \ln\left(\frac{9}{10}\right) + \cdots\ln\left(\bf{\frac{n}{n+1}}\right)\\
\end{align}
and $$\text{as,}\quad n\to\infty\qquad\qquad\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left(\bf{\frac{n}{n+1}}\right) = 1$$ 
thus, $$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\bf{ln}\left(\bf{\frac{n}{n+1}}\right)=0\text{,}$$
that is, $$\lim\limits_{k\to\infty} a_k = 0\text{,}$$ 
So it  should   converge , we also observe that all the terms inside $log$ are  less than 1  so all the individual $\textit{log }$ values would be  negative  and thus making the sum of series negative. 
 We also observe that as $n\to\infty$ the values inside $log$ will tend to $0$ from  negative  side(because each individual $log$ value is negative)thus, the absolute value of individual $log$ values would slowly decrease, with the greatest absolute value of $ln\left(\bf{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$ 
 But we can write the above series in another way :
\begin{align}
& = \ln(1)-ln(2)+\ln(3)-\ln(4)+\ln(5)-\ln(6)\cdots\infty\\
& = \qquad-\ln(2)+\ln(3)-\ln(4)+\ln(5)-\ln(6)\cdots\infty\qquad\qquad\{\ln(1)=0\}
\end{align}
It becomes :
$$\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) + \ln\left(\frac{5}{4}\right) + \ln\left(\frac{7}{6}\right) + \ln\left(\frac{9}{8}\right) + \ln\left(\frac{11}{10}\right) + \cdots\ln\left(\bf{\frac{n+1}{n}}\right)$$
Again,
$$\text{as,}\quad n\to\infty\qquad\qquad\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left(\bf{\frac{n+1}{n}}\right) = 1$$ 
thus, $$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\bf{ln}\left(\bf{\frac{n+1}{n}}\right)=0\text{,}$$
that is, $$\lim\limits_{k\to\infty} a_k = 0\text{,}$$  
 So it  should   converge , we also observe that all the terms inside $log$ are  greater than 1  so all the individual $\textit{log }$ values would be  positive  and thus making the sum of series positive. 
 Now this is where it CONTRADICTS our above statement that the sum of series would be negative 
 We also observe that as $n\to\infty$ the values inside $log$ will tend to $0$ from  positive  side(because each individual $log$ value is positive)thus, the absolute value of individual $log$ values would slowly decrease, with the greatest absolute value of $ln\left(\bf{\frac{3}{2}}\right)$ 
 One may further argue that in our original expression: 
 $$\lim\limits_{n \to  \infty }  \sum\limits_{k=1}^n - (-1)^{k} \ln (k)$$ 
 the series  does not Converge  as our  necessary  condition,
$$\lim\limits_{k\to\infty} a_k = 0$$ 
does not satisfy because $- (-1)^{n} \ln (n)$ tends to $\infty$ or $-\infty$ depending on the value of $'n'$ as $n\to\infty$, thus contradicting our another statement that : 'this series converges' 
 Now at last, how do we calculate the  limit  of this series (even an approximate value). 
 Edit : What would be the answer to the same question if the series would have been:
$$\lim\limits_{n \to  \infty }  \sum\limits_{k=1}^n - (-1)^{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$$

"For matrix Lie groups, the exponential map is usually defined as a mapping from the set of $n \times n$ matrices onto itself.  
 However, sometimes it is useful to have a minimal parametrization of our Lie algebra elements. Therefore, there is the hat operator $\hat{\cdot}$ which maps a $m$-vector onto the corresponding Lie algebra element 
 $$ \hat{\cdot}: \mathbb R^m \rightarrow g, \quad \hat{\mathbf x} = \sum_{i=0}^m x_i \mathtt G_i, $$ 
 where $\mathtt G_i$ is called the $i$th generator of the matrix Lie algebra $g\subset \mathtt R^{n\times n}$ (especially by physicists). I am very much interested in the properties of this function.  
 Example for SO3:  
$\hat{\mathbf x} = \begin{bmatrix} 0&-x_3& x_2\\ x_3&0,&-x_1\\-x_2&x_1&0\end{bmatrix}$  
 Question 1:  Does the function $\hat{\cdot}$ has a common name? Would ""change of basis"" transformation (from the standard basis to the Lie algebra basis) be the right name? 
 I guess in this context it make sense to assume that the family $\mathtt G_1,...,\mathtt G_m$ is linear independent. From the linear independence it follows that $\hat{\cdot}$ is bijective, right? Thus, there is an inverse function $v$ which maps a matrix Lie algebra onto the corresponding Lie algebra: 
 $$ v(\cdot): g
 \rightarrow \mathbb R^m$$
 Example for SO3:  $v(\mathtt R)= \begin{bmatrix}R_{3,2}\\R_{1,3}\\R_{2,1}\end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}R_{3,2}-R_{2,3}\\R_{1,3}-R_{3,1}\\R_{2,1}-R_{1,2}\end{bmatrix} = -\begin{bmatrix}R_{2,3}\\R_{3,1}\\R_{1,2}\end{bmatrix} $ 
 Question 2:  Is there a closed form solution to write down/calculate the inverse of $\hat{\cdot}$? 
 I find it a bit confusing that the standard basis vectors are element of $\mathbb R^m$ while $\mathtt G_i$ are element of $\mathbb R^{n^2}$.

"There are 20 teams in the English Premier League. Of these 20, there is generally considered to be a clearly defined 'top six' - Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham. 
 Let us assume that on a given match-day, these twenty teams are paired randomly.  
 I am trying to find the following on a given match-day: 
 $P(a)$ is the probability that each 'top six' team plays another 'top six' team 
 $P(b)$ is the probability that there are exactly two match-ups between 'top six' teams 
 $P(c)$ is the probability there is exactly one match-up between 'top six' teams 
 I know that the number of ways to split a group of $n$ elements into pairs is given by: 
 $$X(n)= \frac{n!}{2^{\frac{n}{2}}(\frac{n}{2})!}$$ 
 So, to find $P(a)$, there are $X(6)$ ways to pair off the 'top six' teams and for each of those ways, there are $X(14)$ ways to pair off the remaining teams. Thus, 
$$P(a)=\frac{X(6)X(14)}{X(20)} = 0.0031$$ 
 To find $P(b)$, my plan was to find the probability of at least two match-ups and then subtract $P(a)$ from this. This is where I get a bit uncertain. There are $\binom{6}{4}$ ways to select groups of 4 'top six' teams and then 3 different ways to create two pairs from any given group of 4. And then for each of set of two pairs, there are $X(16)$ ways to pair off the remaining teams. Thus, 
 $$P(b)=\frac{\binom{6}{4}X(4)X(16)}{X(20)}-P(a)= 0.136 $$  
 Finally, there are $\binom{6}{2}$ ways to select a pair of 'top six' teams. And for each pair, there are $X(18)$ ways to pair off the remaining teams.  
 $$P(c)=\frac{\binom{6}{2}X(18)}{X(20)}-P(a)- P(b)= 0.650 $$  
 Adding these together, there should be a 78.9% chance of at least 1 'top six' match-up occurring on any given match day.  
 However, if I calculate the odds at least one 'top six' match-up, wouldn't it also just be: 
 $$1 - (\frac{14}{19})(\frac{13}{17})(\frac{12}{15})(\frac{11}{13})(\frac{10}{11}) = 0.653$$

 As far as I can tell, if we take the limit of  $(1)$  when  $y \to \infty$  we get  $0$ . 
 I believe what is happening is that a linear approximation is being used in the denominator. 
 Here's what I came up with: 
 Rewrite  $E_p$ 
 $$E_p = \frac{1}{y\sqrt{y^2+\frac{l^2}{4}}}$$ 
 $$=\frac{1}{y\sqrt{y^2(1+\frac{l^2}{4y^2})}}$$ 
 $$=\frac{1}{y^2\sqrt{1+\frac{l^2}{4y^2}}}$$ 
 Consider the term in the denominator  $1+\frac{l^2}{4y^2}$ 
 $$s=\frac{l}{2y}$$ 
 $$1+(\frac{l}{2y})^2=1+s^2 = f(s)$$ 
 $$y>>l \implies s \approx 0$$ 
 I believe I can use a first order Taylor's expansion 
 $$\implies f(s) \approx f(0) +f'(0)s,\text{ near s=0}$$ 
 $$\implies f(s) \approx 1$$ 
 $$E_p \approx \frac{1}{y^2}$$ 
 On the other hand I could have simply started by considering the limit of  $E_p$  when  $\frac{l}{y} \to 0$ .  In this case my question is: how does one calculate this limit? It's clear that the term in the square root goes to zero, but what should we say happens to the  $y^2$  term? 
 Is this latter limit somehow connected or equivalent to the linear approximation I used, and was my calculation correct?

"I am trying to work out what the probability that  $n$  coin toss sequences of length  $k$  match in  $m$  spots. The simplest example would be two sequences of a given length. If I toss a coin 100 times, twice, how many of positions in the sequence will match? My intuition tells me that if I have a fair coin (so  $p = 0.5$ ) then I should expect two random sequences to on average, agree in 50% of their locations. I also think that I am correct in saying that the probability of two sequences of length  $k$  being in complete agreement is  $p^q (1-p)^{(k-q)}$  where  $q$  is the number of heads in the sequence. 
 However, I am unable to formalize my particular question (which is a fraction of the sequence, independent of subsequence length), nor am I able to extend this to the probability that 3 sequences of a particular length agreeing in 50% of their locations. Any help would be appreciated.  
 Edit : To be more specific, I am having difficulty with the combinatorics involved when the probability  $p \neq 0.5$ . Suppose the first sequence contains 2 heads. It can be  $HHTT$  or  $HTHT$  or  $THTH$  etc.. it doesn't matter. Now I want to calculate the probability that another sequence matches  $0, 1, 2, 3, \mathrm{or}\ 4$  of those outcomes. I have chosen  $HHTT$  as the first sequence and enumerated the possible matching sequence for each case.  
 In the case of 0 matching outcomes, the only possibility is  
 \begin{array}{cccc}
& T & T & H & H \\
\end{array} 
 In the case of 1 matching outcome, the possibilities are:  
 \begin{array}{cccc}
& H & T & H & H \\
& T & H & H & H \\
& T & T & T & H \\
& T & T & H & T \\
\end{array} 
 In the case of 2 matching outcomes, the possibilities are:  
 \begin{array}{cccc}
& H & H & H & H \\
& H & T & T & H \\
& H & T & H & T \\
& T & H & T & H \\
& T & H & H & T \\
& T & T & T & T \\
\end{array} 
 In the case of 3 matching outcomes, the possibilities are:  
 \begin{array}{cccc}
& H & H & T & H \\
& H & T & T & T \\
& H & H & H & T \\
& T & H & T & T \\
\end{array} 
 Finally, for all 4 matching outcomes, the only possibility is:  
 \begin{array}{cccc}
& H & H & T & T \\
\end{array} 
 Now the number of combinations for matching  $m$  outcomes for a sequence of length  $k$  is given by  ${k\choose m}$ . The only problem is, because the probability is not  $0.5$ , I need to enumerate how many of those contain  $x$  number of  $H$ , so I can sum up  $p^q (1-p)^{(k-q)}$ , each multiplied by the appropriate prefactor. However,  I am unable to identify the appropriate pattern . This is the main difficulty I am having.  
 Any help towards figuring out a formula for the probability of two (or more!) sequences of length  $k$  matching in  $m$  spots, where the probability of each outcome  is not  0.5 would be greatly appreciated.

"In Satoshi Nakamoto's paper :  Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System , he describes a scenario where an attacker is trying to add falsified transactions to the blockchain.  
 He writes : ""The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its lead by  $+1$ , and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by  $-1$ .  
 We can calculate the probability he ever
reaches break-even, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows"" :

But if you find the definite integral of any other interval you get different answers. For example 0 to 1.

For the $2x$ (anti derivative $x^2$) I imagine it to calculate the work done section by section so when you calculate say the interval of 0 to 1 you only get the answer of the work done moving a small section of the cable by 1 feet, exactly the section that only moved one feet when you pull the rope up the building and the answer you get does not equal to the whole cable moving one feet. So it does not equal to the total work done on the cable moving one feet up the building. The other formula I will need to have someone explain what it represent. 
 Also i do not understand what the textbook is saying at all when it stated let's place the origin at the top of the building and the x-axis pointing downward as in figure 2 not provided. We divide the cable into small parts with length $\Delta x$. If $X_i$ is a point in the $i$-th such interval, then all points in the interval are lifted by approximately the same amount, namely $X_i$. The cable weighs 2 pound per foot, so the weight of the $i$-th part is $2 \Delta x$. Thus the work done on the $i$-th part in foot-pounds is $2 \Delta x$ (force) $\times X_i $(distance).

"I apologize for the juvenile, and probably incorrect, math you are about to see. I have no intention of gambling. This post is made solely from curiosity. Anyways, I am underage, and thought of the idea merely while reading  The Gambler . 
 Some roulette tables have 15 slots: 
 
 1 green, which multiplies your bet by 14x. 
 
 7 red and 7 black, which multiply your bet by 2x. 
 
 
 The idea is to wait till there is a long streak without a single green, say, 20 rolls from the previous green, and then start continuously betting on green until it lands. Repeat this process. Slowly increasing your bet by 1/15 per unsuccessful roll to ensure profit. A 'roll' is one round (1 spin of the roulette wheel). 
 The crux of this theory is the law of big numbers. As you execute more unsuccessful bets, the likelihood of a green bet occurring increases to match the average probability of getting green, even if rolls are independent of one another. I will plug in some calculations. 
 Assuming that I have 1000 dollars in total, and start off betting 1 dollar. I increase my bet by 1/15x (estimated to 0.07) every unsuccessful roll. Then we can calculate the total number of rolls my 1000 dollars will permit me (assuming all rolls are unsuccessful). 
 $y = x(1.07)^n$ , y = total capital, x = starting bet, n = number of unsuccessful bets 
 $1000 = 1(1.07)^n, n=102$ 
 We can execute 102 bets before running out of money. So, plugging in the binomial formula to calculate the probability of a string of unsuccessful bets, we use the formula: 
 $P(L)=(a | b)(x)^b (y)^(a-b)$ , where a = number of unsuccessful rolls, b = number of successful rolls we want, x = probability of a successful roll, y = probability of an unsuccessful roll 
 $P(L)=(102+20 | 1)(1/15)^1(14/15)^(102+20-1)$ , therefore P(L) is 0.0019 (0.19%), and therefore the probability of profit in the above mentioned case is 99.81%. 
 I use the number 102+20 as the number of unsuccessful rolls, this is because 20 accounts for the 20 unsuccessful rolls we observe before placing continuous bets on green. Unsuccessful rolls mean rolls that do not land on green, and vice versa. 
 Now, I am absolutely sure I made an error in that (if you spot it please do point it out), but otherwise, why is this theory incorrect? I am sure it is, but I am not smart enough to figure out why. 
 Of course, it is far likelier that you will hit a green in your first 14 bets, thus making a notable profit. But that is not the point of the post, which is to see whether this theory is likely to fail and bankrupt in practice.

 $$P_N\sim \alpha^N$$ 
for some  $\alpha$ , but I don’t know how to calculate this constant. 
 I did manage to figure out that if we keep  $q$  constant, then the probability of eventual extinction starting with  $N$  bacteria is exactly equal to
 $$\bigg(1-\frac{p-q}{p(1-q)}\bigg)^N$$ 
for  $p>q$ , and equal to  $1$  for  $p\le q$ . But that problem was much easier because “newborn” bacteria were independent from their parents, whereas in this problem the chance of each bacterium’s survival is dependent on the overall population size. 
 So, really my question is: what is the value of
 $$\lim_{N\to\infty}P_N^{1/N}=\space ?$$

"My first question on math stackexchange. 
 I have two numbers, $n$ and $m$.  Their values will vary but I always know what they are and they're always positive integers (and multiples of 2, but that doesn't make much difference). 
 I want to find the smallest number both $n$ and $m$ will perfectly divide into. 
 E.g.$$\begin{align*}n&=32\\m&=144\end{align*}$$ 
 Smallest number they will both divide into is $288$. 
 I can see how to work this out iteratively ($n*m$, then keep dividing by 2 until you find the first number they both won't divide into, the previous value is the desired value) but I can't see how to calculate it directly (and I need to). 
 For those who ae wondering what this is for, it's do with memory allocation on an ARM platform.  I want to be cache line aligned and also exclusive reservation granuale aligned.  There, that helped ;-) 
 So if the cache line width is 32 bytes and the ERG is 144 bytes, I want to allocate with alignment on 288 bytes. 
 What it amounts to is this;
$$nx - my = 0$$ 
 Except that defines many values and I want the smallest value of $nx$ and $my$ where this is true.
$$\begin{align*}
    nx &= my\\
    \frac{nx}{ my} &= 1\\

I know $n$ and $m$, so $\frac{n}{m} = c$
$$\frac{x}{y}=c$$

"Let $ \exp : M(n, \mathbb{C}) \rightarrow GL(n, \mathbb{C}) $ be the matrix exponential defined by $$ \exp(X) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{X^k}{k!} $$
Is this map smooth as a map from $ \mathbb{C}^{n^2} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n^2} $ ? 
 My attempt: I show that the derivative at $ 0 $, $ D\exp(0) $ is the identity linear transformation on $ \mathbb{C}^{n^2} $, thus the derivative is nonsingular. This is because we have $$ \frac{|| \exp(H) - \exp(0) - H ||}{||H||} = \frac{||\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{H^k}{k!}||}{||H||} \le \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{||H||^{k}}{(k+1)!} $$ and the limit of the last expression as $ ||H|| \rightarrow 0 $ is clearly $ 0 $.  
 My problems begin at the following: (1) I can calculate the derivative only at scalar matrices in $ M(n, \mathbb{C}) $ (I need commutativity for the identity $ \exp(A+B)=\exp(A)\exp(B) $ to hold) (2) I cannot apply the inverse function theorem yet, because I have established differentiability at only a point. 
 How would one get around these difficulties? I know that the inverse function theorem holds for analytic functions too, but I would like to avoid it, and in any case, I would need to show that the derivative is nonsingular everywhere. I cannot see a coordinate free approach.

"Problem 
 I'd like to write code that solves the following problem: 
 
 Take 5 arbitrary points in Cartesian coordinates  $(x,y,z)$ . 
 Check whether there is an ellipse that goes through them all  (with some tolerance for floating-point inaccuracies) . 
 If so, find the ellipse's
 
 center  $\mathbf{c}$ , 
 major radius  $a$  (length of the semi-major axis), 
 minor radius  $b$  (length of the semi-minor axis). 
 
 
 
 
 Canonical approach 
 Similar discussions  tend to already start with five points in 2D space. 
Extending that to 3D points, I suppose the ""canonical"" approach would look like this: 
 
 Check that all five points are coplanar, and determine that plane. 
 Convert the five 3D points to 2D points on that plane. 
 Use the five  $(x,y)$  points to solve the conic equation  $$ax^2+by^2+cxy+dx+ey+f=0$$  for the coefficients  $a, b, c, d, e, f$  using some algorithm for solving linear system of equations  (hopefully stable with floating-point numbers) . 
 Check the coefficients to make sure they represent an ellipse, and not another type of conic. 
 Calculate the ellipse properties from the coefficients  ( formulae ) . 
 Convert the ellipse center  $\mathbf{c}$  back to 3D space. 
 
 Is there a shortcut? 
 The above approach seems cumbersome to implement, and possibly inefficient at run-time. 
So, I'm wondering if there's a better way to do this in my case — where input and output is in 3D space, and I'm not actually interested in the full ellipse equation, just the three ellipse properties mentioned above. 
 I'm holding out hope, because for the simpler but conceptually similar problem of  ""finding the circle through three 3D points"" ,  this Wikipedia section  provides a closed-formula solution with just a few dot products and cross products.

"What I mean with ""intuitive"": I can handle some formulas, but since I am not a professional mathematician I am not fluent in all the lingo, so I do not know by heart what ""second countable"" means. If I have to look up all these terms and try to understand them, it takes so much time, that I forget what I was researching in the first place... so basic terminology is appreciated. 
 
 It was previously asked whether  every manifold is a metric space , but I have to admit, I did not completely understand the answers. Assuming that a manifold is second-countable, the answer is ""yes"" (I cannot claim I full understood the property ""second countable""). My (non-completely) translation of the answer  https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1530066/340174  into an intuitive explanation is 
 
 I want to find the distance from  $x_0$  to y, both of which are elements of the manifold. Since a manifold is locally Euclidean, I can walk a infinitely small way in an ""Euclidean"" manner. So, I go a small step from  $x_0$  to  $x_1$  and I calculate the distance I walked, which is possible, because I can just use the Euclidean distance. I walk from  $x_1$  to  $x_2$  until I reach y and add up all the distances to the total distance. From all the possible paths I take the one that is the shortest and that is my distance. 
 
 First question:  It seems intuitively obvious to me that the first three  conditions of a metric  apply to manifold distances, as I described it above. But how do I know that the triangular condition applies as well to the distance over a manifold? Is there an intuitive explanation in the style I tried above? 
 
 Originally I would have guessed (without too much thinking) that every metric space is a manifold, but not the other way around. Since the second part is wrong, I would guess that now, that the first part is also wrong. (Otherwise there would be no need to differentiate the two, right?) But what is that so? I can come of with a metric space, like one based on the Levenshtein distance, which is not continuous and my usual impression of manifolds is that they are continuous (since they are supposed to be Euclidean locally). However it seem there are also  discrete manifolds  (which I do not understand either).

 My idea was to cut the circumference into segments  $\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{n}$ , calculate the distances, sum them up, divide by  $n$  and then let  $n$  approach infinity. 
 $$D(p) = \lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{\sqrt{[x-R cos(i\frac{2\pi}{n})]^2+[y-R sin(i\frac{2\pi}{n})]^2}}{n}$$

"I am currently playing a game that lets you breed horses of 4 different tiers. You can only buy horses of the first tier and by combining two horses of the same tier you may get the horse of the next tier. However when breeding you will always get just 1 horse back. When breeding the chances are as follows: 
 
 20% to advance to the next tier 
 30% to get the next lower tier horse 
 50% to get a horse with the same tier back 
 
 You can never breed two tier 1 horses and get a lower tier horse back as tier 1 is already the lowest tier. For simplicity we say that the price for buying a tier 1 horse is 10 gold. 
 Now to my question:
How can I calculate the chance to get a horse of the highest tier based on a limited amount of money. For example:
How high is the chance to get a horse of tier 4 if I have 100 gold to spend?

"I am trying to calculate the least squares regression line y=mx+b for a set of data points where the sample data for y is an angle in the range -180..180 and x is unbounded scalar.  I realize such a linear equation will produce y values outside of the range -180..180, but that is OK as I can easily re-bound them after the fact.  The trouble I am running into is calculating the least squares coefficients (m and b) over data where y has a circular range.   
 To clarify the data, consider the following: 
 1) X represents time 
 2) Y is an angle returned from a piece of hardware, in the range -180 to 180.  The Y values are cyclical, they will continue to wrap if the sample period is sufficiently long. A reasonable analogy would be the angle of a particular spoke on a wheel over time.  
 3) There is significant noise in the angle data, so I plan to be sampling for long enough to get probably a few thousand samples per collection.  Also, this is the reason I intend on using something like a least squares regression. 
 4) I am changing the conditions in each sample collection.  The change of conditions impact the rate of change in Y over time, but it is always linear, and is not predicable from the conditions without measuring.  Some samples of data may include more than a single cycle of Y (It can wrap around) if the rate is high enough or the sample period long enough 
 4) My ultimate goal is to create a y=mx+b equation for each of the condition sets.  This will allow me to estimate angle Y based on time X.  I am in effect creating a calibration table.   
 Here is some sample data, where I would expect a slope m of approximately 1:

"Since I am not good at math and would like to know something, I ask here. I hope that this question can't be easy solved with Google, because I really have no idea how to call such a calculation to google except probability calculation. 
 Here is my problem:
I have a selection pool full of names, from which I select X times (without double selection). 
 The selection pool is filled as follows:
There are for example 10 names. Each name has its own probability to get into the selection pool. 
 Let us assume that I have these names as an example: 
 
 Name 1 to 5 = 100% 
 Name 6 = 50% 
 Name 7 = 20% 
 Name 8 = 80% 
 Name 9 = 90% 
 Name 10 = 10% 
 
 And in this case I choose a total of 5 names. How high is the probability for each name to be drawn at the end? 
 And if I would add the name ""name 11"" with a probability of 5% to the list of names, how would the probability be calculated? Can you put this into a formula? 
 
 Edit: 
Forgott to write it but the selection pool is only filled one time at the beginning and not after each selection. 
 Edit2: 
The actual case is that when the pool is empty, a new one is generated and the remaining selections are filled. In this case it is possible that double names occur when another pool is generated. But to keep it simple here, I would say that there are simply no more selections than there are names with 100% probability 
 Edit3: 
 I hope that this example will help me to explain it again in an understandable way. 
 Let us assume we have  n  pieces of paper, in this case 10, with names 1 to 10 on them. Each piece of paper has a  probability  to come in a basket. These are the probabilities: 
 
 Name 1 to 5 = 100% 
 Name 6 = 50% 
 Name 7 = 20% 
 Name 8 = 80% 
 Name 9 = 90% 
 Name 10 = 10% 
 
 Now the content of the basket (pool) is generated. Since names 1 to 5 have a probability of 100%, they are placed directly into the basket. Now a D10 die is rolled for name 6 and if it is 5 or lower, the name is placed in the basket. For name 7 it must be 2 or less, and so on. 
 At the end we have a basket with  X  pieces of paper with names in it and now we draw  Y  times a piece of paper, in this example we draw 5 pieces. How high is the probability that note 6 is in the  Y  (5) drawings? 
 Extra points are given if you can take into account that if the number of draws exceeds the number of cards in the basket, the basket will be regenerated and the remaining draws will be made. 
 Edit4: 
 I have wrote a little program to simulate this and this are the probabilities that i want to calculate and my simlutaions says: 
 After 100.000.000 interations with 5 draws:

 @Ethan Bolker was rigth. It is selecting random elements from a weighted list. I still have no clue if this can be solved with a function or if its only possible to simulate it with a program. 
 Here is some python code, that delivers the sam results as the typescript code above: 
 import random
import math
nameCounts = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
nameList = [""Name1"", ""Name2"", ""Name3"", ""Name4"", ""Name5"", ""Name6"", ""Name7"", ""Name8"", ""Name9"", ""Name10""]
weights = [100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 50, 20, 80, 90, 10]

indexList = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

cycles = 10000000

for x in range(cycles):
    randomSelection = random.choices(indexList, weights=weights, k=5)

    for val in randomSelection:
        nameCounts[val] += 1

for x in range(10):
    percentage = math.floor((nameCounts[x] / cycles) * 100)
    print(str(nameList[x]) + "" with weight "" + str(weights[x]) + "": "" + str(percentage) + ""%"")
 
 Edit6: 
 The python script only allows selecting from a list up to 10 elements. I dont know why but the list I want to use could be longer than that. 
 Edit7: 
 I guess the important variables are: 
 
 Total count of elements =  count 
 Weight/probalility of each element =  weight 
 Elements to be selected =  selections 
 
 Basic examples (simulated with 50.000.000 cycles): 
 count = 2, weight = [100%, 50%], selections = 1: 
 
 100% weight = 75.00% probability 
 50% weight = 25.00% probability 
 
 count = 3, weight = [100%, 50%, 50%], selections = 1: 
 
 100% weight = 58.33% probability 
 50% weight = 20.83% probability 
 50% weight = 20.83% probability 
 
 count = 4, weight = [100%, 50%, 50%, 50%], selections = 1: 
 
 100% weight = 46.865% probability 
 50% weight = 17.723% probability 
 50% weight = 17.705% probability 
 50% weight = 17.705% probability 
 
 count = 3, weight = [100%, 100%, 50%], selections = 1: 
 
 100% weight = 41.66% probability 
 100% weight = 41.66% probability 
 50% weight = 16.66% probability 
 
 count = 3, weight = [100%, 100%, 50%], selections = 2: 
 
 100% weight = 83.33% probability 
 100% weight = 83.33% probability 
 50% weight = 33.33% probability

 So for this I need to compute the winding numbers of the singularities first. Now here is the first question I have:

 Let  $\varphi:\mathbb{R^n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+k}$  be such that  $(M,\varphi)$  is a differentiable manifold, where  $M=\varphi(\mathbb{R}^n)\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ . In other words,  $\varphi$  is a global parametrization for  $M$ . Let  $\langle,\rangle_{\varphi(0)}$  be the inner product in  $T_{\varphi(0)}M$  such that  $\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\vert_{\varphi(0)},\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\vert_{\varphi(0)}\}$  is an orthonormal basis. Now, for  $a\in \mathbb{R}^n$ , we consider  $L_a:M\rightarrow M$ , defined by  $L_a(\varphi(x))=\varphi(x+a)$ . We choose  $\langle,\rangle_{\varphi(a)}$  an inner product in  $T_{\varphi(a)}M$  such that
 $$DL_a(\varphi(0)):T_{\varphi(0)}M\rightarrow T_{\varphi(a)}M$$ 
is an euclidean isometry. Find the components  $g_{ij}$  of  $(M,\langle,\rangle)$ . 
 My attempt: 
 The first thing I did was calculating the localization  $f$  of  $L_a$ :
 $$x\overset{\varphi}{\longmapsto}\varphi(x)\overset{L_a}{\longmapsto}\varphi(x+a)\overset{\varphi^{-1}}{\longmapsto}x+a$$ 
So  $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$  is defined by  $f(x)=x+a$ . Thus, the jacobian matrix of  $f$  is the identity  $I$  and it doesn't depend on the point  $\varphi(x)$  nor  $a$ . Now I want to calculate  $$g_{ij}=\langle\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\vert_{\varphi(x)},\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\vert_{\varphi(x)}\rangle_{\varphi(x)}$$ 
As we know that
 $$DL_x(\varphi(0)):T_{\varphi(0)}M\rightarrow T_{\varphi(x)}M$$ 
is an euclidean isometry, then:
 $$\langle u,v\rangle_{\varphi(0)}=\langle DL_x(\varphi(0))(u),DL_x(\varphi(0))(v)\rangle_{\varphi(x)}$$ 
for all  $u,v\in T_{\varphi(0)}M$ . 
 But the jacobian of the localization of the previous differential is the identity, so  $DL_x(\varphi(0))(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\vert_{\varphi(0)})=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\vert_{\varphi(x)}$ , and we can conclude that:
 $$g_{ij}=\langle\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\vert_{\varphi(x)},\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\vert_{\varphi(x)}\rangle_{\varphi(x)}=\langle\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\vert_{\varphi(0)},\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\vert_{\varphi(0)}\rangle_{\varphi(0)}=\delta_{ij}$$

"I'm trying to calculate the interval of convergence and the values of x in which the series converge absolutely and conditionally

First I calculated the interval of convergence $-1<x<1$, using the root test. 
Then, I looked for the convergence in $x=1$ and $x=-1$ 
 With $x=1$ it was easy: the limit is $e$ so it's divergent in that point. 
But with $x=-1$ it's more difficult, because we have  
 $\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\:\left(1+\frac{1}{\:n}\right)^n(-1)^n$

 $\lim _{m\to \infty }\left(1+\frac{1}{\:2m+1}\right)^{2m+1}(-1)^{2m+1} = - 1$ 
 Shouldn't this limit, by substitution, be equal to $-e$ 
 Can someone please help me to compute this limit OR to find a better process to test the convergence in $x=-1$?

 My attempt: Using the coarea formula:
 $$\int_{\Bbb R^3}\langle x,v \rangle^{20} \;\langle x,w \rangle^{16}\;e^{-|x|}\;dx_1dx_2dx_3=\lim_{r \to \infty }\int_{B_r}\langle x,v \rangle^{20} \;\langle x,w \rangle^{16}\;e^{-|x|}\;dx_1dx_2dx_3 $$

 Now I need to calculate  $\int_{ S^2}\langle y,v \rangle^{20} \;\langle y,w \rangle^{16}dS$ , which is the part I'm having trouble with. Since  $v,w$  are orthogonal vectors of length  $1$ , I can assume without loss of generality (since the surface integral over a sphere doesn't change under orthogonal transformation) that  $v=(0,0,1), w=(0,1,0)$ . Then I'm left with    $\int_{ S^2}y_3^{20}y_2^{16}dS$ , which I'm pretty stuck with. Using the parametrization  $(\varphi, \theta) \mapsto (\cos\theta \sin \varphi,\sin \theta \sin \varphi, \cos \varphi)$ ,  $0\leq \varphi \leq \pi$ ,  $0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$ , we get:

 Two people each toss a fair coin $n$ times. Find the probability that they toss the same number of heads. 
 
 My approach: Person $A$ flips a coin $n$ times. Person $B$ flips a coin $n$ times. So we have a total of $2n$ coin flips. Therefore the total number of outcomes of choosing $n$ flips that land heads is $${2n\choose n}$$
Since we flip a coin $n$ times and the coin is fair. The probability person $A$ and person $B$ toss the same number of heads is thus $$\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^n {2n\choose n}$$ 
 To be more clear: The probability person $A$ lands heads after $n$ flips is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n$ like wise for person $B$ thus we have $$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^n $$ 
 Second approach with helo from Joeb: Let $E_k$ be the event where each person flips exactly $k$ heads we want to calculate $$\sum_{k=0}^{n}P(E_k)$$
Individually we have a probability of $${n\choose k}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n$$ Thus together $$\sum_{k=0}^{n}P(E_k) = \sum_{k=0}^{n}{n\choose k}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n{n\choose k}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^n\sum_{k=0}^{n}{n\choose k}{n\choose k} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^n{2n\choose n} $$

Given the two circle-centres, I need to quickly calculate the maximum size I can give the squares such that a square will not intersect another square's circle.

 The quickest simplest approximation seems to me just to extend each square 
 min( abs(y - y'), abs(x - x') ) / 2
 
 so the squares just touch. But in some cases, this still leaves room we could have grown the squares. 
 For example, here the squares cannot be enlarged as the squares would immediately intersect each other's inscribed circles: 
 
 But in this case, we could still grow the squares a bit:

which corresponds to the well-known prisonder's dilemma. Now a Nash Equilibrium by using pure strategies would be (G,G) cause by choosing them neither can improve his outcome by unilaterally changing his strategy. 
 Now I wanted to calculate a Nash Equilibrium for mixed strategies using this payoff-matrix.
(I am using an algorithm proposed at the  German wikipedia Article on Nash-Equilibrium ). So, I am looking for a mixed strategy for player II which makes player I indifferent regarding his strategy choices, and vice versa. 
 Let $q$ be the probability that player II chooses $S$ and accordingly $(1-q)$ that he chooses $G$, then the expected values for player I are
\begin{align*}
  EV(I | S) & = (-2)q + (-6)(1-q) \qquad \textrm{if he chooses $S$} \\
  EV(I | G) & = (-1)q + (-4)(1-q) \qquad \textrm{if he chooses $G$}
\end{align*}
(I use the notation $EV(I | S)$ to mean, expected value of player $I$ when he chooses $S$ and so on). 
 Equating them, to find the probablities for player II which make player I indifferent, I have to solve
$$
 -2q - 6(1-q) = -q - 4(1-q)

which has the solution $q = 2$, which is impossible since q should be a probablity, so with the additional restriction $0 \le q \le 1$ it has no solution? But I heard that Nash-Equilibrium for mixed strategies always exists in finite games, so what did I wrong?

 Then my book is defining the partial derivative of  $f \circ \phi$  at  $u_j$  as  
 
 $$\frac{\partial f\circ \phi}{\partial u_j} = \sum_{i = 1}^p \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial u_j} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}$$ 
 
 But it doesn't mean anything to take the partial derivative at a function!?  So  $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}$  doesn't make sense, since  $x_i$  is a function; I mean we can't calculate the partial derivative at a function.
For example it doesn't mean anything to say  $\frac{\partial (x^2+y^2)}{\partial xy}$ , right?  
 So I guess this is an abuse of notation and that the right formula is

Is this correct? I have two concerns 
 
 $\nabla_{i} \nabla_{j}$  should not be interpreted as  $\nabla_{i}(\nabla_{j} g^{p q}Ric_{pq})$  because it is actually the  $(i, j)$ -th component of  $\nabla \nabla$ . However my impression is that when we are doing this kind of calculation, you do calculate first  $\nabla_{j}g^{pq}Ric_{pq}$ , why? 
 I am using the fact that  $\nabla_{j} g^{pq} = 0$ , which presumably is derived from the fact that  $\nabla g = 0$ .  $\nabla g = 0$  means that when you take the covariant derivative of a (0, 2) two tensor you get 0, but in the expression of the scalar curvature I do not think that  $g^{pq}$  can be interpreted as the component of a (0, 2) tensor. To put it another way, the product rule works for covariant derivative on tensor products by definition but how do we interpret  $g^{pq}Ric_{pq}$  as a tensor product?

 Show in an algebraic way, not using calculator if possible that:  $$2^{123}<5^{53}$$ 
 
 
 First I want to tell that I'm trying to make this post a reference post.  
 
 There are duplicates out there, but none really offers a non-calculator proof, at most they rely on a fine approximation of  $\log_{10}(2)$ , and moreover they are all getting deleted one by one due to no effort showing from the original poster. 
 Since I found a solution, I'd like to expose it here, of course other solutions are welcome as well. 
 
 
 Secondly, the problem is not as easy as it looks and I'll show why: 
 
 The standard idea would be to compare  $2^7\approx 5^3$  ( $128$  vs  $125$ ) but this inequality is the wrong order  $5^3 < 2^7$ . 
 By using it we can prove that  $\ 2^{123}>16\cdot 5^{51}\ $  while we want in fact  $\ 2^{123}<25\cdot 5^{51}$ 
 There is not much room between  $16$  and  $25$  so the inequality is quite tight. 
 
 Another choice would be to consider other approximations like  $\ 2^{16}<5^7\ $  or  $\ 2^{30}<5^{13}$ 
 The latter one is already quite tedious to calculate manually, yet it is not sufficiently tight: 
 You get  $2^{123}=2^{30\times 4+3}<8\times 5^{13\times 4}<8\times 5^{52}$  but still  $8>5$  and cannot conclude. 
 
Note:  
 Some other posters have shown that using  $\log_{10}(2)\approx 0.3010 < 0.3011$  was adequate 
 to prove the claim since  $176\times 0.3011 < 53$ .

 But, I realize that I am over counting some probabilities, as the my calculated value for $P_{ab}$ becomes greater than 1.

 Clearly, the answer is  $4^5$  as each ball can be given to any of the  $4$  persons. However, I wanted to calculate it using a different method. 
 I assumed that  $a$  balls are given to first person,  $b$  to second ,  $c$  to third and  $d$  to fourth person. So we have that  $a+b+c+d=5$  where  $0 \leq a,b,c,d \leq 5$ . 
 But counting the solutions to the above equation assumes that balls are identical. So I tried to find the number of distributions each permutation of  $(a,b,c,d)$  produces. That will be  $\displaystyle \binom{5}{a}\cdot \binom{5-a}{b}\cdot \binom{5-a-b}{c} $  which equals  $\dfrac{5!}{a!b!c!d!}$ . 
 So, now we need to sum this value over all  $a,b,c,d$  satisfying  $a+b+c+d=5$ . Now there are  $\displaystyle \binom{8}{3}=56$  solutions to the equation. So there will be  $56$  terms in that summation. So how do we do that?

"I have been given the function $$F(x)=\frac1x\int_0^x\frac{1-\cos t}{t^2}\,{\rm d}t$$ for $x\ne 0,$ $F(0)=\frac12,$ and charged with finding a Taylor polynomial for $F(x)$ differing from $F$ by no more than $5\times 10^{-10}$ on the interval $[-1,1].$ 
 
 My First (problematic) Approach : 
 $\dfrac{1-\cos t}{t^2}$ agrees with the power series $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+2)!}t^{2k}$$ for all $t\ne 0,$ so since that series converges everywhere--and in particular converges uniformly on $[-1,1]$--then we have $$\begin{align}xF(x) &= \int_0^x\frac{1-\cos t}{t^2}\,dt\\ &= \int_0^x\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+2)!}t^{2k}\,dt\\ 
&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+2)!}\int_0^xt^{2k}\,dt\\ &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+2)!(2k+1)}x^{2k+1}\\ &= x\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+2)!(2k+1)}x^{2k}\end{align}$$ for all $x\in[-1,1].$ Furthermore, we have $$F(0)=\frac12=\frac{(-1)^0}{2!\cdot 1}\cdot 1=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+2)!(2k+1)}0^{2k},$$ and so $$F(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+2)!(2k+1)}x^{2k}$$ for all $x\in[-1,1].$ 
 It seemed that I should be able to use this power series to determine Maclaurin polynomials of any (nonnegative even) degree I cared to choose, but there were a few problems with this. For one, I couldn't see how to find a nice bound for the remainder, since I hadn't actually calculated any of the derivatives of $F.$  For another, once I  did  calculate the first several derivatives, it became clear that the $n$th derivative of $F$  fails to be defined  at $x=0$ when $n\ge3,$ so the ""obvious"" polynomial approximations are not actually Maclaurin polynomials, after all.  [ Edit : Never mind about that second problem. Turns out I mistyped the third derivative I found in Wolfram Alpha, resulting in a functions which had no limit as $x\to0.$] 
 
 My Second Approach : 
 I tried calculating the derivatives of $F$ so that I could explicitly develop the Taylor polynomials, and still be able to use the Taylor remainder. Unfortunately, I've not found any clear pattern that I can exploit to give a closed form for the $n$th derivative of $F$ in general. Here are the first several (with the rewrite of $F$ coming via integration by parts), which hold for all $x\ne0$: 
 $$F(x)=-\frac1{x^2}(1-\cos x)+\frac1x\operatorname{Si}(x)\\F'(x)=\frac2{x^3}(1-\cos x)-\frac1{x^2}\operatorname{Si}(x)\\F''(x)=-\frac6{x^4}(1-\cos x)+\frac2{x^3}\operatorname{Si}(x)+\frac1{x^3}\sin x\\F'''(x)=\frac{24}{x^5}(1-\cos x)-\frac6{x^4}\operatorname{Si}(x)-\frac7{x^4}\sin x+\frac1{x^3}\cos x\\F^{(4)}(x)=-\frac{120}{x^6}(1-\cos x)+\frac{24}{x^5}\operatorname{Si}(x)+\frac{46}{x^5}\sin x-\frac{10}{x^4}\cos x-\frac1{x^3}\sin x\\F^{(5)}(x)=\frac{720}{x^7}(1-\cos x)-\frac{120}{x^6}\operatorname{Si}(x)-\frac{326}{x^6}\sin x+\frac{86}{x^5}\cos x+\frac{13}{x^4}\sin x-\frac1{x^3}\cos x$$ 
 Here, $$\operatorname{Si}(x):=\int_0^x\frac{\sin t}t\,dt.$$ 
 It seems fairly clear that for any integer $n\ge0$ and any $x\ne0$ we will have $$F^{(n)}(x)=\frac{(-1)^{n+1}(n+1)!}{x^{n+2}}(1-\cos x)+\frac{(-1)^nn!}{x^{n+1}}\operatorname{Si}(x)+p_n\left(\frac1x\right)\sin x+q_n\left(\frac1x\right)\cos x,$$ where $p_n$ and $q_n$ are some univariate polynomials determined by $n.$ In particular: 
 
 $p_n\equiv0$ for $n=0,1;$ for $n\ge2,$ $p_n$ is a degree $n+1$ polynomial that is odd (origin-symmetric) when $n$ is even, even ($y$-axis symmetric) when $n$ is odd. 
 $q_n\equiv 0$ for $n=0,1,2;$ for $n\ge 3,$ $p_n$ is a degree $n$ polynomial that is odd when $n$ is odd, even when $n$ is even. 
 
 I suspect I can even prove the above by induction (though I haven't tried it, yet). I'm not seeing a clear way to tell what the coefficients of $p_n$ and $q_n$ are, in general, though. Probably this is a case of oversimplifying, but perhaps the coefficients don't have a nice closed form. 
 
 I'd like to do one of the following things: 
 
 Determine closed forms for the derivatives of $F(x).$ 
 Determine a point $x_0\ne0$ and a sufficiently large $n$ such
that the $n$th Taylor polynomial of $F(x)$ centered at $x=x_0\ne0$
is within $5\times 10^{-10}$ of $F$ on the interval $[-1,1].$ (It
seems like, in order to make $n$ as small as possible and still have
the coefficients relatively easy to calculate, we should make
$x_0=\frac\pi2$ or $x_0=\pi$ or some such, but this is just an
idea, and I have not confirmed this.) 
 
 If anyone can help me to proceed along one of these paths, it would be appreciated. Alternative methods and hints of any kind would also be welcome.

 My current though process is to define the Kitchen ~ exp(1/30), Bathroom ~ exp(1/40), and Rake1 ~ exp(1/60) / Rake 2 ~ exp(1/30). From here, we can see that if cleaning the bathroom or kitchen takes longer than cleaning the other room + raking then obviously the expected time is just the expected time to clean that room. Outside of that, we can calculate the E(max(Kitchen,Bathroom)) = 30 + 40 - 1/(30 + 40). But after this I am lost as to how to get the final result.

 $\frac{dC_{e}}{dt}=k_{e0}C_{1}(t)-k_{e0}C_{e}(t)$ 
 These equations model the distribution of a drug in the human body according to a multi-compartmental model where: 
 
 $C_{1}$: concentration in compartment 1 (bloodstream). 
 $C_{2}$: concentration in compartment 2 (richly perfused, mostly muscle). 
 $C_{3}$: concentration in compartment 3 (poorly perfused, mostly fat). 
 $C_{e}$: concentration at effector site (brain). 
 $C_{inf}$: concentration of infusion (for a drug given intravenously at a constant rate, the rate divided by the volume of distribution of compartment 1). 
 $k_{10}$: constant of elimination from compartment 1. 
 $k_{12}$, $k_{13}$, etc.: constants of equilibration between compartments. 
 $k_{e0}$: constant of equilibration to effector site (it is assumed to be the same in both directions). 
 t: time. 
 
 All the above are known except for $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, $C_{3}$ and $C_{e}$. We also know what the 4 concentrations are at t = 0. 
 I have done Laplace transforms of these equations (with the aid of the computer program Maxima) and solved the system for the Laplace transforms. I have not been able to calculate the inverse of the transforms, so I have used Zakian's method to obtain a numerical approximation to the inverse of the Laplace transforms. 
 This approach works reasonably well and provides quite accurate results, but it is computationally intensive, and therefore too slow to draw graphics on the fly. Also it bugs me to use a numerical approximation when there may be an exact solution. 
 This link  seems to indicate that for a simpler two compartment model it is possible to find an exact solution by doing Laplace transforms, solving the system of equations, and then inverting the transforms. 
 Is my system of equations solvable? If so, I would be very grateful for some pointers.

"We have the ring  $R$  and the polynomial  $a=x^3+x+1$  in  $R[x]$ . I want to check the following statements: 
 
 If  $R=\mathbb{R}$  then  $a$  is irreducible in  $\mathbb{R}[x]$ . 
 This statement is false, since according to Wolfram the polynomial has a real solution, right? But how can we calculate this root without Wolfram, by hand? 
 
 If  $R=\mathbb{Z}_5$  then  $a$  is irreducible in  $R[x]$ . 
 The possible roots are  $0,1,2,3,4$ . We substitute these in  $a$  and we get the following:
 \begin{align*}&0^3+0+1=1\neq 0\pmod 5 \\ &1^3+1+1=3\neq 0\pmod 5 \\ &2^3+2+1=11\equiv 1\pmod 5\neq 0\pmod 5 \\ &3^3+3+1=31\equiv 1\pmod 5\neq 0\pmod 5 \\ &4^3+4+1=69\equiv 4\pmod 5\neq 0\pmod 5\end{align*} 
So since none of these elements is a root of  $a$ , the statement is correct, right? 
 
 If  $R=\mathbb{C}$  then  $a$  is irreducible in  $R[x]$ . 
 This statement is wrong, because from the first statement we have that  $a$  is reducible in  $\mathbb{R}[x]$ , and so it is also in  $\mathbb{C}[x]$ . Is this correct? 
 
 If  $R=\mathbb{Q}$  then  $a$  is not irreducible in  $R[x]$ . 
 Since this is a cubic polynomial, it is reducible if and only if it has roots.
By the rational root test, the only possible rational roots are  $\pm 1$ .
Since neither of these is a root, it follows that  $a$  is irreducible over  $\mathbb{Q}$ , right? 
 
 If  $R=\mathbb{C}$  then  $a$  has no root in  $R$ . 
 This statement is wrong, since from statemenet 3 we have that  $a$  is reducible in  $\mathbb{C}[x]$  and so it has roots in  $\mathbb{C}$ , or not?

"I'm working on  Project Euler #23  and for the first time so far, I'm really confused, and the more I Google, the more confused I get. 
 The problem states: 
 
 A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors
  is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper
  divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28
  is a perfect number. 
 A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is
  less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n. 
 As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the
  smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers
  is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers
  greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
  However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis
  even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be
  expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit. 
 Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as
  the sum of two abundant numbers. 
 
 My initial algorithm is... 
 
 Calculate all abundant numbers (<= 28123). 
 Calculate all numbers that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. (Brute force style - with a nested loop, literally adding every possible combination of the calculated abundant numbers and inserting the sums into an array). 
 Determine all numbers (<= 28123) that do not appear in the generated array of sums. 
 
 This seemed like a sound approach - it's basically the same one  Kristian at Mathblog  outlined, but it's not only super inefficient with significantly longer run time than all my previous solutions, but it also gave me the wrong output.  
 I didn't fully understand Kristian's code because  a , I don's speak C, and  b  the dude is summing the factors of  prime  numbers in his first code block...? What the actual heck is going on here? What do primes have to do with it? 
 Seeking further clarification I ran into  this article  which casually states: 
 
 All  highly composite numbers  or anti-primes greater than six are abundant numbers. 
 
 However, the linked Wikipedia article lists 7 thru 11 as ""highly composite numbers"" and I know that 12 is the smallest abundant number, so there's no possible way the above statement could be accurate... right? 
 
 I'm not looking for code, just an efficient, understandable algorithm in plain English. I'm also not a Math person so please try to use small words if you can. I just need to understand that secret prime number sauce Kristian used so I can implement it. I need that voodoo magic from the number gods explained in a way I can understand it.

"I was trying to find an interesting problem for my physics students involving a nontrivial flux integral, and I came up with one that produced the integral 
 $$\int \frac{dx}{1+\beta\cos x}$$ 
 ( $\beta^2<1$ ). I resorted to the computer algebra system Maxima in order to integrate it, and that worked, but I wanted to understand what it had done. Playing around and searching on the web showed that this is an example that can naturally be approached using Bioche's rules, but the only description of those I could find was a  French language wikipedia article . I'm finding the article hard to understand, I think not so much because of my weak French as what seems to be some archaic notation or old-fashioned ways of thinking about what we would today call a function. The WP article seems to say this (my attempted translation): 
 In the following  $f(t)$  is a rational expression in  $\sin t$  and  $\cos t$ . Then in order to calculate  $\int f(t)dt$ , one forms the integrand  $\omega(t)=f(t)dt$ . Then: 
 
 If  $\omega(-t)=\omega(t)$ , a good change of variables is  $u=\cos t$ . 
 If  $\omega(\pi-t)=\omega(t)$ , a good change of variables is  $u=\sin t$ . 
 If  $\omega(\pi+t)=\omega(t)$ , a good change of variables is  $u=\tan t$ . 
 If two of the preceding relations both hold, a good change of variables is  $u=\cos 2t$ . 
 In all other cases, use  $u=\tan(t/2)$ . 
 
 I'm having a hard time interpreting the distinction between  $f$  and  $\omega$ . Presumably rule 1 is equivalent to saying that  $f$  is even. In 2, is the idea to do the substitution  $t\rightarrow \pi-t$ , which also implies  $dt\rightarrow-dt$ ? This would seem equivalent to  $f(\pi-t)=-f(t)$ ...? 
 Is there a reason not to just express the rules in terms of  $f$ ? 
 My faith in my own translation/understanding is not reinforced when I try to apply the rules to my own example. It seems that 1 holds, because  $f$  is even. Then the substitution  $u=\cos x$  transforms my integral into 
 $$-\int\frac{du}{\sqrt{1-u^2}(1+\beta u)},$$ 
 but this doesn't actually seem any better. It seems like the most general substitution  $u=\tan(x/2)$  is required.

 I have an axis-aligned ellipse at the origin, with axes $a$ and $b$. Parallel to the major axis, there are two line segments with lengths $D_1$ and $D_2$. The line connecting the ends of the line segments is a tangent to the ellipse, it touches but does not intersect the ellipse. 
 The question is: given $a$, $b$ and the ratio $F = {D_1\over D_2}$, how to calculate the lengths of $D_1$ and $D_2$? 
 Some notes on current progress: 
 
 I believe the solution exists and is uniquely defined. Every $F$ ratio defines a set of lines, but only one of these lines touches the ellipse. 
 The $F$ ratio on its own does not determine the angle between the tangent line and the $x$ axis. $D_1=2$, $D_2=1$ has a different angle than $D_1=20$, $D_2=10$. 
 If it is useful, can make assumptions like $b=1$ and $a > b$ and $D_1 > D_2$, since these do not lose generality and I can translate it to an arbitrary ellipse and $F$ ratio afterwards.

Hence the the average number of sixes rolled is  $\bar{k} = \sum_{n=0}^{100}n {100 \choose n} \left( \frac{1}{6}\right)^n \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^{100-n}$ . I opened excel and computed the above equation and obtained  $\bar{k} \approx 16.7$ . 
 I checked the solutions at the back of the textbook, and indeed that is the correct answer. However, my worry is that the second exercise requires us to do the same, but this time with systems composed of  $10^8$  dice. 
 Obviously, there is no way I can use excel to do such a calculation, so I am not sure on how I could approximate a solution. I thought about using a Gaussian distribution, but I do not see how I could set it up so it tells me the specific number of sixes rolled. Any ideas?

"Problem: 
 For how many two-element subsets  $\{a, b\}$  of the set  $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \dots , 36\}$  is the product  $ab$  a perfect square? 
 Note: 
 The numbers  $a$  and  $b$  are distinct, so the  $a$  and  $b$  must be different integers from the set of numbers  $1 - 36$ . 
 Reiteration: 
 Using two integers selected from the number group,  $1-36$ , how many combinations are possible so that the product of the two numbers selected is a perfect square. 
 Attempt: 
 First list out the square numbers between 1-36 (inclusive): 
 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36. 
 NOTE: The square number “1” does not work because  a  and  b  need to be distinct. 
 Rewrite the numbers paired with the number “1” so that it is in the format {a, b}. 
 (4, 1)
(9, 1)
(16, 1)
(25, 1)
(36, 1) 
 Next, since the number “16” for example, it can be broken down into 4•4 or 8•2, the subset {8, 2} also works. 
 4 : 2•2 (Note: 2•2 does not work because  a  and  b  need to be distinct)
16 : 4•4 or 8•2 (Note: 4•4 does not work because  a  and  b  need to be distinct)
36 : 2•18 or 3•12 or 4•9 
 Currently, we have found 9 solutions. 
 Issue: 
 I currently found 9 out of the total number of solutions that satisfy this problem. But, I have ran into an issue : What is the most efficient way to organize your solutions and find other combinations? 
 Attempt Continued: 
 I then continued to list out the combinations but started with the sets with “1” in the front and then 2, then 3, then 4, etc. 
 Subsets which start with “1”: 
 {1, 4}
{1, 9}
{1, 16}
{1, 25}
{1, 36} 
 Subsets which start with “2”: 
 {2, 8}
{2, 18}
{2, 32} 
 Subsets which start with “3”: 
 {3, 12}
{3, 27} 
 Subsets which start with “4”: 
 {4, 9}
{4, 16}
{4, 25}
{4, 36} 
 Subsets which start with “5”: 
 {5, 20} 
 Subsets which start with “6”: 
 {6, 24} 
 Subsets which start with “7”: 
 {7, 28} 
 Subsets which start with “8”: 
 {8, 18}
{8, 16} 
 Conclusion: 
 The list keeps going on. The correct answer for this question is 27. If you carefully calculate and list out the subsets, you can get the answer.

 Here is my partial solution: Let  $X$  be the given space, let  $Y$  be the top and bottom edge, and let  $Z = I \cap \mathbb{Q}$ . We have  $H_k(Y) = 0$  for  $k > 0$ , so  $H_k(X) \approx H_k(X, Y)$  for  $k>1$  using the long exact sequence for the pair  $(X, Y)$ . Note that  $(X, Y)$  is a good pair (i.e.  $Y$  is a deformation retract of a neighbourhood in  $X$ ), and  $X/Y$  is the suspension  $SZ$ . Therefore,  $H_{k+1}(X, Y) \approx \widetilde H_{k+1}(X/Y) \approx \widetilde{H}_k(Z)$ , using the relationship between the homology of a space and the homology of its suspension. This gives  $H_{k+1}(X) \approx \widetilde{H}_k(Z)$  for  $k>0$ . The latter is  $0$  since  $Z$  is totally disconnected, so  $X$  has trivial homology in dimensions 2 and above.

 Suppose $x$ is an $n$ x 1 vector, $A$ is an $n$ x $n$ matrix. $A$ does not depend on $x$, and also $\alpha = x^TAx$.  
 Let $\alpha = \sum_{j=1}^{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i a_{ij} x_j$ 
 Differentiating wrt to the $k^{th}$ element of x: 
 $\frac{\delta\alpha}{\delta x_k} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_ia_{ik} + \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{kj}x_j$ for all $k$ = 1, ... , $n$

This is because for each $k$ (which are the columns of $A$) we calculate a sum-product using the vector $x$ and the $k^{th }$ column of $A$. But how does the $\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{kj}x_j$ component result in $x^TA^T$ and not $Ax$ in $\frac{\delta\alpha}{\delta \boldsymbol{x}}$ since we are effectively calculating the sum product of $x$ and the $k^{th}$ row of $A$?

"I'm trying to obtain the Taylor series for  $f=\sin^5 x$  at the point  $\alpha = 0$ , by using the known Taylor series of  $\sin x$ , then taking its  $5$ th power, as such  $$\Bigl(x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}+ \cdots \Bigl)^5.$$ 
 Now all that needs to be done, is to calculate the coefficient of each term individually. This doesn't seems like a good solution, and I feel like I'm really misunderstanding the point of Taylor series at this point. 
 Anyway, a bigger confusion I have, is that if you were to start calculating the derivatives of  $\sin^5(x)$ , it would not really yield anything meaningful. For example ( the first derivative )  $$f^{(1)} = 5\sin^4x\cdot \cos x.$$ 
 So  $f^{(1)}(\alpha) = 0$  when  $\alpha = 0$ , and so the first term is just  $\frac{0}{1!}\cdot(x-\alpha)^1=0$ . The 2nd and third terms are  $0$ , as the corresponding derivatives are  $0$  at  $\alpha = 0$ . This is not reflected in the actual series, which has non-zero terms in their place.

"This is a question I have from stochastic control. I know that in general  $\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup \mathbb E\left[f(X,y)\right]\leqslant \mathbb E\left[\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup f(X,y)\right]$ . I normally would assume that the reverse inequality does not always hold, just like in typical inequalities, such as with  Jensen's inequality , but in the proof below, I see that a similar equality is proven, which makes it seem as if  $\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup \mathbb E\left[f(X,y)\right] = \mathbb E\left[\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup f(X,y)\right]$  holds, but I don't fully understand/agree with part of the proof. 
 
 In the following,  $\mathbb E\left[f(X_T)|\mathcal F_t;\pi\right]$ , is saying that the stochastic process  $X_t$  is controlled by the process  $\pi$ , not that  $\pi$  is assumed known. The argument is from   Markov Decision Processes and Dynamic Programming  at the top of page 9.  
 In the solution for  Bellman's principle  (discrete time), I have seen that the following is done, for admissible control processes  $\pi$ :
 \begin{equation}
\underset{\pi} \sup \mathbb E\left[V^{\pi}(t+1,X_{t+1})|X_t=x; \pi\right] = E\left[\underset{\pi} \sup V^{\pi}(t+1,X_{t+1})|X_t=x; \pi\right]
\end{equation} 
which is proven by showing both inequalities hold. So:
 \begin{equation}
\underset{\pi} \sup \mathbb E\left[V^{\pi}(t+1,X_{t+1})|X_t=x; \pi\right]\leqslant E\left[\underset{\pi} \sup V^{\pi}(t+1,X_{t+1})|X_t=x; \pi\right]
\end{equation} 
which I can see follows from  $\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup \mathbb E\left[f(X,y)\right]\leqslant \mathbb E\left[\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup f(X,y)\right]$ 
 Then the reverse inequality is proven, where  $\pi^* =   \underset{\pi} {\text{argmax}}\left[\underset{\pi}\sup V^{\pi}(t+1,X_{t+1})\right]$ 
 \begin{equation}
 E\left[\underset{\pi} \sup V^{\pi}(t+1,X_{t+1})|X_t=x; \pi\right] =  E\left[V^{\pi^*}(t+1,X_{t+1})|X_t=x; \pi^* \right]\leqslant \underset{\pi} \sup \mathbb E\left[V^{\pi}(t+1,X_{t+1})|X_t=x; \pi\right]
\end{equation} 
which follows by the definition of supremum.  
 
 I am wondering how come we can't just do this same procedure for  $\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup \mathbb E\left[f(X,y)\right]\leqslant \mathbb E\left[\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup f(X,y)\right]$ , and show that equality holds there as well. The issue seems to be with the step of the reverse inequality and I also can think of some simple examples that seem to defy the equality.  
 For example: There is just one time step, from  $T-1$  to  $T$ , and the probability space has just  $3$  points:  $\{ \omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3\}$ , all with equal likelihood. There is a function  $f(y,X_T(\omega))$ , for  $y \in \{0,1\}$ , such that whenever  $y = 0$ ,  $f(0,X_T(\omega)) = 30$ , and that when  $y = 1$ ,  $f(1,X_T(\omega_1)) = -3000$ ,  $f(1,X_T(\omega_2)) = -3000$ , and  $f(1,X_T(\omega_3)) = 300$ .  
 So if we wanted to calculate  $\underset{y\in \{0,1\}} \sup \mathbb E\left[f(y,X_T(\omega))\right]$ , we maximize the expectation over choices of  $y$ , so the choice would be  $y = 0$ , for a value of  $30$ , regardless of the state of the world. And for  $ \mathbb E\left[ \underset{y\in \{0,1\}} \sup f(y,X_T(\omega))\right]$ , we choose  $y = 1$  when the state of the world is  $\omega_3$  and  $y = 0$  otherwise, and so since each possibility has equal weighting, the value of the expression is  $\frac{300 + 30 + 30}{3} = 120$ , which doesn't match the  $30$  from  $\underset{y\in \{0,1\}} \sup \mathbb E\big[f(y,X_T(\omega))\big]$ .  
 So if we consider the control process to be the choice of  $y$ , then this poses a contradiction with the proof of the  Bellman principle . One issue I see with my example is that the supremum on the outside of the expectation seems to not be able to 'look into the future' while the supremum on the inside of the expectation can. I'm not sure how to reconcile this.  
 
 So I think my main questions are:  
 
 Can my simple (possibly incorrect) example be reconciled with how the proof for the Bellman principle was done?  
 What exactly  $\underset{\pi} \sup V^{\pi}(X_{t+1})$  means and how it can be evaluated. Is it a random variable, where the maximum of  $V^{\pi}(X_{t+1})$  is chosen across policies, depending on the state of the world? 
 
 Any clarification would be appreciated. I've been trying to get this answered for a while now. I'll award the bounty and correct answer even for just a link that'll help explain things! Thanks a lot!

"I have been recently trying to review some topics on improper integrals. The Integral I am trying to solve is: 
$$
\int_0^\infty {log(x) \over x^2 -1} dx
$$ 
 
 The branch cut of the $log(x)$ is excluded by rotating the red line by an infinitesimal angle M. The origin and the pole on the real axis are both excluded by going around them. I have denoted the semicircle around the origin with $S_{\epsilon}$ and the other semicircle around the pole at 1 with $S_\delta$. The large semicircle is  $S_R$. $\epsilon$, $\delta$ and $R$ are the corresponding radii. On the described contour $\Gamma$  the integral should vanish. The integral is 
 $$
\int_\Gamma {log(x) \over x^2 -1} dx = \int_R^\epsilon {log(re^{i\pi})e^{i\pi} \over r^2 -1} dr + \int_\pi^0 {log(\epsilon e^{i\phi})\epsilon e^{i\phi} \over (\epsilon e^{i\phi})^2 -1} d\phi + \int_\epsilon^{1-\delta} {log(r) \over r^2 -1} dr + \int_\pi^0 {log(\delta e^{i\phi})\delta e^{i\phi} \over (\delta e^{i\phi})^2 -1} d\phi + \int_{1+\delta}^R {log(r) \over r^2 -1} dr + \int_\epsilon^{1-\delta} {log(r) \over r^2 -1} dr + \int_0^\pi {log(R e^{i\phi})R e^{i\phi} \over (R e^{i\phi})^2 -1} d\phi = 0
$$ 
 Taking the limits $R \to \infty$, $\delta \to 0$ and $\epsilon \to 0$, the integrals over the semicircles $S_{\epsilon}$ , $S_\delta$ and $S_R$ vanish. Therefore we are left with: 
 $$
\int_0^\infty {log(r)+i\pi \over r^2-1}dr + \int_0^\infty {log(r) \over r^2-1}dr=2\int_0^\infty {log(r) \over r^2-1}dr+\int_0^\infty {i\pi \over r^2-1}dr = 0
$$ 
 The last integral is divergent (Mathematica), however, again according to Mathematica the answer to my question is $\pi^2 \over 4$. I have tried to calculate the last integral by using the same contour as before without the indent contour $S_\epsilon$ around zero and including only the pole at $r=1$ with factor $\frac12$. This second contour I have denoted by $\gamma$. If I had tried to go a full half circle, I would have had both poles at $r=1$ and $r=-1$ included and the residue theorem would have given me zero. Therefore I have excluded one of them by the wedge and obtained
$$
\int_\gamma {i\pi \over r^2-1}dr = \int_R^0 {i\pi e^{i\pi} \over r^2-1}dr + \int_0^R {i\pi \over r^2-1}dr = 2 \int_0^\infty {i\pi \over r^2-1}dr =i \pi Res({i\pi \over r^2-1},r=1)
$$
Evaluating the residue I have obtained precisely $-{\pi^2 \over 2}$. Is this selection of contour allowed? Dropping one pole and keeping the other? Is the selection of the integration contour that arbitrary? I always have such moments doubt. This is why I would appreciate any ideas or comments.

"In GRE exam practice, I got the following question: 
 
 Mitchell plans to work at a day camp over the summer. Each week, he will be paid according to the following schedule: at the end of the first week, he will receive \$1. At the end of each subsequent week, he will receive \$1, plus an additional amount equal to the sum of all payments he’s received in previous weeks. How much money will Mitchell be paid in total during the summer, if he works for the entire duration of the 8-week-long camp? 
 
 To do the solution, I came up with the following formula for  $n$ -week-long camp: 
 $$n + (n-1) * 2^0 + (n-2) * 2^1 + (n-3) * 2^2 + ... + (n-(n-1)) * 2^{n-2} + (n-n) * 2^{n-1}$$ 
 But in this formula, the number of terms are dependent on  $n$ . So, it is going to be harder to calculate by hand for larger  $n$ . 
 So, I googled it but found no straight-cut formula where the number of terms are not dependent on n. 
 Could you help me? I mean, could you give me such formula or a proof that such formula does not exist?

"I have been asked to prove that the Galois group of $x^5+x^4-4x^3-3x^2+3x+1$ (presumably over $\mathbb{Q}$ is cyclic of order $5$.  Unfortunately, I have no idea where to start. 
 The hint says to show that this is the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_{11} + \zeta_{11}^{-1}$.  Which I guess I could do by plugging it into the polynomial, but there is most likely a better way to do it.  Anyway, even if I could establish that, I wouldn't know any of the other roots so it's not like I could find any of the automorphisms.  I guess it would kind of help because it would show that the Galois group had order divisible by 5.  Except a lot of them are.  I think I am completely missing the point of the hint. 
 The section was about how you could reduce polynomials mod $p$, and the Galois group would have to contain a permutation with cycle type $(n_1 n_2 ... n_k)$, where $n_1$, ..., $n_k$ are the degrees of the irreducible factors (mod $p$).  But this is not very relevant because since the group is cyclic of prime order, all the permutations would be 5-cycles.  And lots of other subgroups of $S_5$ have 5-cycles too. 
 So at this point I am kind of stuck.  Can you give me a hint as to how to solve the problem?  Thanks! 
 P.S. We are allowed to use the computer program SAGE for this assignment, but not the command that calculates the Galois group.  Also, I tried to use SAGE to calculate the roots but it gave me numerical answers.

"I'm looking at a random variable that takes vectors $\newcommand{\vv}{\mathbf{v}} \vv_1, \dotsc, \vv_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and calculates their average, after applying ""blankout"" noise to them. So we have independent Bernoulli random variables $\xi_1, \dotsc, \xi_n$ with parameters $p(\xi_i = 1) = p_i$. I multiply the $\newcommand{\vv}{\mathbf{v}} \vv_i$ by the $\xi_i$ and take the average of the ones that remain: 
 $$\newcommand{\vv}{\mathbf{v}} \frac{\xi_1 \vv_1 + \dotsb + \xi_n \vv_n}{\xi_1 + \dotsb + \xi_n}.$$ 
 This might bother me because I'd be dividing by zero in the trivial case where I take the average of none of them. I suppose I could fix that by adding a dummy term to the denominator that will only show up if all $\xi_i$ are zero. 
 $$\newcommand{\vv}{\mathbf{v}} \frac{\xi_1 \vv_1 + \dotsb + \xi_n \vv_n}{\xi_1 + \dotsb + \xi_n + \prod_i(1 - \xi_i)}.$$ 
 
 Is there a clean way to calculate the mean and variance of such a thing*? (We could leave the $\prod$ term out if we want, and add some other fix.) 
 Is there a better (perhaps standard) way to accomplish this? For instance, use constants $a_i>0$ such that $\mathbb{E}(a_i\xi_i) = \frac1n$, and write it as  
 
 $$\texttt{Avg} \approx \newcommand{\vv}{\mathbf{v}} a_1\xi_1 \vv_1 + \dotsb + a_n \xi_n \vv_n?$$

"Suppose we have a vector $y$ that represent $m$ dice with a potentially varying number of faces (let's call this number $k_i$, where $i$ goes from $1$ to $m$). Let's also suppose that $x_{max}$ is an input that states the max number that can be present in any combination of the dice after being thrown, and that must be present in  at least one  of these. 
 I'm interested in the probability of such an event, so I would need a generic formula where I can provide a vector $y$ of $m$ dices with $k_i$ faces and max integer $x_{max}$. 
 I understand that the probability of at least one case occurring would be: 
 $$
P(X) = \prod_{i=1}^{m} \frac{1}{k_i}
$$ 
 To consider all cases that fit the criterion I would need to multiply $P(X)$ by the number of all cases $n$, that would yield $P(T)$. This is where I'm having a problem: Im not sure how to arrive at the generic formula to calculate all the possible cases that fit the criterion.

 EDIT:
The result must be of the form:
$$\frac{a}{s}\pm ibs\text{ sign}(k)\delta(-p^2)$$
where $a,b$ are constants, and $s$ is the module of a vector measured with a metric of minkowsky type $\text{diag}(-1,1,1,1)$, where the $0$ component is $k$ and the $3d$ part has module $p$. 
 All in all, the integral comes from calculating a green function that ends up being: 
 $$\frac{1}{4\pi(x-x')}\int_0^\infty e^{-ik(t-t')}\sin[k(x-x')]dk$$
And the result should be:
$$\frac{1}{8\pi^2(x-x')^2}-\frac{i}{8\pi}\text{ sign}(t-t')\delta(-(x-x')^2)$$

 Assuming there are 4 cards of the suit left in the game and one is in AI's hand, I need to calculate probability that one of the other players would take the hand. Here's an example: 
 AI player has: J
Other 2 players have: A, K, 7 
 If a single opponent has AK7 then AI would lose. However, if one of the players has A or K without 7, AI would survive. Now, looking at possible distribution, I have:

AK   7    survives

K7   A    survives
A    7K   survives
K    7A   survives
7    KA   survives

 Looking at this, it seems that there is 75% chance of survival.

"I'm looking for literature on fractional iterates of $x^2+c$, where c>0.  For c=0, generating the half iterate is trivial. 
$$h(h(x))=x^2$$
$$h(x)=x^{\sqrt{2}}$$ 
 The question is, for $c>0,$ and $x>1$, when is the half iterate of $x^2+c$  smaller  than the half iterate of $x^2$?  We know that the full iterate is always larger, since $x^2+c>x^2$, for $c>0$, and $x>1$. Intuitively, one would think that the half iterate of $x^2+c$ would also always be larger, but I believe I have found some counter examples. 
 In examining the parabolic case for $c=0.25$, I believe $x=800000000$ is a counter example.  $800000000^{\sqrt{2}} \approx 3898258249628$, but I calculate the half iterate of $f(x)=x^2+0.25$, $h_{x^2+0.25}(800000000) \approx 3898248180100$, which is smaller.   
 For $c=0$, this is the equation for the superfunction which can be used to calculate fractional iterations.  $f(x)=x^2$, and $g(x) = f^{o x}$, $g(z) = 2^{2^z}$.  For $c=0.25$, this is the parabolic case, which has been studied a great deal in understanding the mandelbrot set, and the superfunction is entire, and I presume there is a uniqueness criteria.  For $c>0.25$, the problem becomes trickier because $x^2+c$ has complex fixed points, and I am also looking for any literature on unique solutions to calculating real valued fractional iterates for $c>0.25$.    
 What I am also interested in is the abel function of $x^2$, which is $\text{abel}(z) = \log_2(\log_2(z))$.   I am interested in the abel function of $x^2$ composed with the superfunction of $x^2+c$.
$$\theta(z)=\text{abel}_{x^2}(\text{superfunction}_{x^2+c}(z))-z$$ 
 As real $z$ increases, if $\theta$ converges to a $1$-cyclic function, as opposed to a constant, then there are counter examples like the one I gave, and sometimes the superfunction is growing slower than $2^{2^z}$, and othertimes it is growing faster, with the two function intersecting each other an infinite number of times.  I'm also wondering if $\theta$ converge to an analytic function?  Any relevant links would be appreciated.

"This is my first question here so I hope I'm doing it right :) sorry otherwise! 
 As in the title, I was wondering if and when it is OK to calculate a limit i three dimensions through a substitution that ""brings it down to two dimensions"". Let me explain what I mean in a clearer way through an example. I was calculating this limit: 
$$\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{\ln (1+\sin^2(xy))}{x^2+y^2} =\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{\ln (1+\sin(xy)\cdot \sin(xy))}{x^2+y^2}$$
$$=\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{\ln (1+xy\cdot xy)}{x^2+y^2} =\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{\ln (1+x^2y^2)}{x^2+y^2}=\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^2y^2}{x^2+y^2}$$
$$=\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)}\frac{1}{\frac{1}{y^2}+\frac{1}{x^2}}=""\frac{1}{\infty}""=0.$$
Where I have used:
$$ \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{\sin(xy)}{xy}=[z=xy]=\lim_{z\to 0}\frac{\sin z}{z}=1$$
and 
$$ \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{\ln(1+xy)}{xy}=[z=xy]=\lim_{z\to 0}\frac{\ln(1+z)}{z}=1.$$
Is the way I calculated the limits for $(x,y)\to (0,0)$ by substituting with $z=xy$ legit? 
Also, if it is... am I allowed to substitute an expression with its limit  inside  a limit, as in  while  calculating the limit, or can I only take the limits in one last step (I'm a bit confused by this exercise in general, I have solved it with Taylor series but I'm curious to know whether this works too)?

"I am trying to calculate what is the probability of the 3 random cards of 52-pack containing at least two of the same suit. 
 I am also trying to do the same for the four card variant (so, the successful outcome would be all 4 are of the different suits). 
 With three cards, my calculation is as follows: 
 1st card is random and doesn't matter what suit it is.
The second one must be one of the remaining 39 of 51 and the third one must be one of the remaining 26 of 50. 
 So the total p_flush draw (3 cards) = 1-52/52*39/51*26/50. 
 With four cards, its the same as with previous example, but with one last addition: 
 p_flush draw (4 cards) = 1-52/52*39/51*26/50*13/49

"I have a task which says the following: 
 A planar curve is given by 
$$x=\cos(t)+t,\\y=t^2+2t+1.$$
I had to calculate for which value of the parameter $t$ does the curve pass through the point $P=(1,1)$, which i calculated to being $0$.  
 The next question is:
 What is the curvature of the curve at the point P? 
 With the different possible answers:
a)$\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$,
b)$\frac{4}{5\sqrt{5}}$,
c)$\frac{4}{{5}}$,
d)$\frac{3}{5\sqrt{5}}$,
e)$\frac{5}{3\sqrt{5}}$. 
 Bonus info: Results list says the correct answer is b. 
 
 To solve this I have tried using the theory connected to determining said curvature, which says if we have a curve: $r(t)=\langle x,y\rangle$, the curvature is found using kappa:  
 $$\kappa=\frac{\|\vec T'(t)\|}{\|\vec r'(t)\|} \tag{1}\label{kappa}$$, where $\vec T(t)=\frac{\vec r'(t)}{\|\vec r'(t)\|} \tag{2}\label{Toft}.$ 
 So I tried differenciating $r(t)$ and let $t=0$ so I could insert into equation (\ref{Toft}): 
 $r(t)= \langle \cos(t)+t,t^2+2t+1 \rangle$ 
 $r'(t)= \langle -\sin(t)+1,2t+2 \rangle$ 
 $r'(0)= \langle -\sin(0)+1 , 2\cdot0+2 \rangle \rightarrow \langle 1,2 \rangle$ 
 $\vec T(t)=\frac{\langle 1,2 \rangle}{\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} \rightarrow \frac{\langle 1,2 \rangle}{\sqrt{5}} \rightarrow \Bigl\langle \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \Bigr\rangle$ 
 I then calculated $\|\vec T'(0)\|$ so it could be inserted into equation (\ref{kappa}) 
 $\|\vec T'(0)\| = \sqrt{\Bigl(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\Bigr)^2 + \Bigl(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\Bigr)^2} \rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{1^2}{\sqrt{5}^2} +\frac{2^2}{\sqrt{5}^2} } \rightarrow \sqrt{ \frac{1}{5} + \frac{4}{5}} \rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{5}{5}} \rightarrow \sqrt{1} = 1
$ 
 Finally I insert into (\ref{kappa}):
$$\kappa = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$$
see that I get one of the possible answers, then check the results list and see that I am getting the wrong result.. Anyone who knows what I am doing wrong and possibly can help me out? Thanks in advance =)

"Okay, first I'm a bit ashamed to ask because I already asked a question yesterday about a similar question (it's from far not the same integral though), but I'm missing an  $i$  somewhere in the process, that's why I'm asking haha. 
 I'm asked to evaluate the following integral :  $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(z)}{(z^2+2z+2)^2}dz$$  which is the real part of 
 $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{iz}}{(z^2+2z+2)^2}dz$$  which is much simpler to evaluate obviously. 
 The poles are at  $z=-1\pm i$ . I evaluate the integral in the upper half circle, so only  $-1+i$  is in our domain. When I calculate the derivative (pole of order 2), I get  $$\frac{1}{1!}\lim_{z\to-1+i}\frac{d}{dz}(z-(-1+i))^2\frac{e^{iz}}{(z^2+2z+2)^2} =\lim_{z\to-1+i}(z-(-1+i))^2 \frac{ie^{iz}(z^2+2z+2)-e^{iz}2(2z+2)}{(z^2+2z+2)^3} = \lim_{z\to-1+i}(z-(-1+i))^2 \frac{-e^{iz}2(2z+2)}{(z^2+2z+2)^3}=\frac{-4ie^{i(-1+i)}}{8i^3}=\frac{e^{-1-i}}{2}$$  But an  $i$  seems to be missing given that when I multiply by  $2\pi i$ , I get  $\pi ie^{-1-i}$  while WolframAlpha gets  $\pi e^{-1-i}$ . A real (and not imaginary) result would also make more sense given that we then have to take the real part of it to get the original integral with  $cos(x)$ . 
 As yesterday, I checked my work several times and couldn't find the mistake, that's why I'm asking haha.

 Calculate the probability  $\mathbb{P}\{Y<2X\}$ . 
 
 I am trying to view this problem in a measure-theoretic perspective and I am wondering if I am thinking about this properly. 
 Let  $(\Omega ,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$  be a probability space on which we define two random variables (measurable functions)  $X$  and  $Y$ . We then consider their joint distribution, the pushforward measure of the random variable  $T(\omega )=(X(\omega ),Y(\omega ))$  on  $\left (\mathbb{R}^2,\mathcal{B}\times \mathcal{B}\right )$  defined by $$T_\star \mathbb{P}(A)=\mathbb{P}\left (T^{-1}(A)\right )=\mathbb{P}((X(\omega ),Y(\omega ))\in A).$$ Then by the question, we have that  $\dfrac{dT_\star \mathbb{P}}{d\lambda}=f_{X,Y}$  i.e. the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the pushforward of  $T$  with respect to the Lebesgue measure is the pdf of  $(X,Y)$ . 
 How can I then calculate  $\mathbb{P}\{Y<2X\}$ ? Somehow I have to relate the probability of this set to the pushforward measuere of which I know the density. What is the theorem that allows me to relate these two measures? 
 Essentially, im looking for the measure of the set  $\{\omega :Y(\omega )<2 X(\omega )\}\subset \Omega$ . I know the density of a measure on  $\mathbb{R}^2$  which is a different set than  $\Omega$ .  How  do I know that  $\{(x,y):y<2x\}\subset \mathbb{R}^2$  is the subset of  $\mathbb{R}^2$  with which I need to integrate over?

 I started by calculating  $(T - \lambda I)^{-1} =: R_{\lambda}$ . I believe that in this case this is  $R_{\lambda}x = (\xi_2 + \lambda, \xi_1 + \lambda, \xi_3 + \lambda, \cdots...) = (T + \lambda I) x$ . Now I didn't really have an ansatz so I just tried to calculate wether  $R_\lambda$  is bounded 
 $$
||R_\lambda x||^2 = ||(T + \lambda I)x||^2 = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |(\xi_2 + \lambda, \xi_1 + \lambda, \xi_3 + \lambda, ...)|^2
$$ 
 The way I see it, this sum only converges for  $\lambda = 0$ . All other lambdas would turn the sequence into a non-null sequence, so the sum can't converge anymore. What this tells me is that every  $\lambda \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$  is part of the continuous spectrum of  $T$ . However we learned a theorem that the spectrum of a bounded operator on a Banach space is contained in the disk  $|\lambda| \le ||T||$ . Afaik  $l^2$  is a banach space and  $||T|| \le 1$ , but the calculated spectrum is definitely outside this disk. 
 So what am I missing? It is probably something obvious, as I said I'm just starting to try to understand spectral theory.

"I am a third year undergraduate mathematics student. 
 I learned some basic techniques for simplifying sums in high school algebra, but I have encountered some of the more interesting techniques in my combinatorics classes and math contests. Many of my favorite techniques involve showing some sort of bijection between things. 
 However, I feel that I have learned almost no new cool integration technique since I took the AP Calculus exam in high school. The first combinatorics book I remember reading had a large chunk devoted to interesting techniques for evaluating summations, preferably with bijective techniques. I have yet to encounter a satisfying analog for integrals. 
 There are two main things I have had difficulty finding out much about: 
 
 What ""subject"" (perhaps a course I can take, or a book I can look up) might I look into for finding a plethora of interesting techniques for calculating integrals (e.g. for summations I might take a course in combinatorics or read ""Concrete Mathematics"" by Knuth et al)? 
 I am particularly interested in analogs for ""bijective proofs"" for integrals. Perhaps there are techniques that look for geometric interpretation of integrals that makes this possible? I often love ""bijective proofs"" because there is often almost no error-prone calculi involved. In fact, I often colloquially define ""bijective proofs"" this way--as any method of proof in which the solution becomes obvious from interpreting the problem in more than one way. 
 
 I don't know how useful it would be to calculate interesting (definite or indefinite) integrals, but I feel like it would be a fun endeavor to look into, and as a start I'd like to know what is considered ""commonly known"".

"Let  $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$  be a smooth even function. Define  $g:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$  by  $g(x)=f(|x|)$ . How to show that  $g$  is smooth at the origin?

 $$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x^i}=\begin{cases} f'(|x|)\frac{x^i}{|x|} & \text{if $x\neq 0$} \\ 0 & \text{if $x=0$.}\end{cases}$$

"I would like to choose arbitrarily two vectors $a$ and $b$ $\in \mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ and I would like to calculate the probability they are at least some distance $\delta$ apart. This probability should be
$$\frac{|\mathbb{S}^{n-1}|-|\{ x \in \mathbb{S}^{n-1}: \|x-a\| \leq \delta \}|}{|\mathbb{S}^{n-1}|}$$
So (I think), my problem consists of finding $|\{ x \in \mathbb{S}^{n-1}: \|x-a\| \leq \delta \}|$ ($|\cdot|$ being the surface measure in $\mathbb{R}^n$). I suppose $a$ can be taken as the unit vector $(1, 0, \cdots, 0)$. By symmetry, the points $\{ x \in \mathbb{S}^{n-1}: \|x-a\| = \delta \}$ should be a ""circle"" with center somewhere on the line between $(0, \cdots, 0)$ and $a$. 
I need to find that center and the radius. I search for a point on the ""circle"" with only the first two components being non-zero: The center should have coordinates $(1-x, 0, \cdots, 0)$ and the point on the circle has coordinates $(1-x, y, 0, \cdots, 0)$. $x$ and $y$ need to verify
$$x^2 + y^2 = \delta$$ and $$(1-x)^2 + y^2 = 1$$ This gives $x = \delta / 2$ and $y = (\sqrt{3}/4) \delta$. Going back to the surface we want to calculate:
$$|\{ x \in \mathbb{S}^{n-1}: \|x-a\| \leq \delta \}| = |\{x \in \mathbb{S}^{n-1}\}\cap \{B((1-\delta / 2, 0, \cdots, 0), r = (\sqrt{3}/4) \delta)\}$$
This should just be the measure of the spherical cap of the sphere centered at $(1-\delta / 2, 0, \cdots, 0)$. To estimate this surface area, I wanted to use that surface area is the push-forward measure of a Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ under $x \rightarrow x/\|x\|$ (times the measure of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ since the latter is a probability measure). So to estimate the above measure, we can also calculate the Gaussian measure of a cone (rays going from $0$ to points in $\{x \in \mathbb{S}^{n-1}: \|x-a\| \leq \delta\})$. Parametrizing this cone, I get $(t, \text{""disc of radius"" }t*\frac{\sqrt{3}\delta}{4(1-\delta/2)}) = (t, disc)$
$$(2\pi)^{-n/2}\int_{(t, disc)}e^{-\|x\|^2/2} = (2\pi)^{-n/2}\int_0^{\infty}e^{-t^2/2}\int_{(disc)}e^{(x_2^2 + x_3^2 + \cdots + x_n^2)/2}dxdt$$
The last integral is over a radial function so
$$ = (2\pi)^{-n/2}\int_0^{\infty}e^{-t^2/2}\omega_{n-2}\int_0^{t*\frac{\sqrt{3}\delta}{4(1-\delta/2)} }e^{-s^2/2}dsdt$$
We can take $\delta$ as very small, so
$$= (2\pi)^{-n/2}\int_0^{\infty}e^{-t^2/2}\omega_{n-2}t*\frac{\sqrt{3}\delta}{4(1-\delta/2)}dt \leq (2\pi)^{-n/2}\omega_{n-2}\sqrt{3}\delta$$
EDIT: In the end, we have to multiply with $|\mathbb{S}^{n-1}|$ since the above is only the uniform probability on $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ 
 Are these calculations correct? I am a bit confused about the term $(2\pi)^{-n/2}$, then $\delta$ could be quite large and we would still not occupy a large amount of the mass.

"Given any number $n$, what is the method of finding out how many possible ways (unique) are there in which you can partition it - with the condition that all the numbers in each 'part' must be greater than or equal to 5. 
 e.g. say $n = 17$ 
 So, $17$ can be written as: 
 
 $17$ 
 $5 + 12$ (since the least number in each part must be 5) 
 $ 6 + 11 $ 
 $ 7 + 10 $ 
 $ 8 + 9 $ (same as $9 + 8$) 
 $ 5 + 6 + 6 $ 
 $ 5 + 7 + 7 $ 
 
 So $17$ can be partitioned in $7$ ways. 
 The question then is, what is the algorithm to find the number of all possible ways (the ways themselves aren't important)? 
 My way : use DP. 
 Let's say the function we are gonna write is $f$. 
 Calculate $f(5)$ ( $= 1$), remember it.
Similarly calculate $f(6)...f(9)$ 
 Now, coming to $f(10)$
from 10, at most we can cut off $5$ and hence $10 = 5 + 5$ 
 Do this recursively and check for duplicates.  
 The problem with my method :
But this seems a really naive algorithm and it seems to be slow (with all the checking of duplicates). 
 So, I am looking for some better method.

"Edit: replaced all c's with y's as the c just denotes replacing a series of coupled linear equations Ay with uncoupled equations $\Lambda c$ no biggie. 
 Im working through the lecture notes for a course on computational modelling of flow and transport. The first Section is on Numerical Methods for IVPs. The text wants to derive order of accuracy by calculating truncation error as  
 $$ \tau_{\Delta t} = \frac{y^{n+1} - y^{n-1}}{2 \Delta t} - \lambda\big(\frac{1}{6}y^{n+1} + \frac{2}{3}y^n + \frac{1}{6}y^{n-1}\big)\ with\ \lambda\ being\ a\ complex\ number $$  
 so I tried to calculate the truncation error by expanding taylor series of $ y^{n+1} $ and $ y^{n-1} $  
 $$ \tau_{\Delta t} = \Big(y + \Delta t y' +\frac{\Delta t^2 y''}{2} +\frac{\Delta t^3 y^{(3)}}{6} +\frac{\Delta t^4 y^{(4)}}{24} +\frac{\Delta t^5 y^{(5)}}{120} - y + \Delta t y' -\frac{\Delta t^2 y''}{2} +\frac{\Delta t^3 y^{(3)}}{6} -\frac{\Delta t^4 y^{(4)}}{24} +\frac{\Delta t^5 y^{(5)}}{120} \Big) \div 2 \Delta t - \lambda \Big( \frac{y}{6} + \frac{\Delta t y'}{6} +\frac{\Delta t^2 y''}{12} +\frac{\Delta t^3 y^{(3)}}{36} +\frac{\Delta t^4 y^{(4)}}{144} +\frac{\Delta t^5 y^{(5)}}{720} + \frac{2 y}{3} + \frac{y}{6} - \frac{\Delta t y'}{6} +\frac{\Delta t^2 y''}{12} -\frac{\Delta t^3 y^{(3)}}{36} +\frac{\Delta t^4 y^{(4)}}{144} -\frac{\Delta t^5 y^{(5)}}{720} \Big)$$  
 so cancelling obvious terms:  
 $$ \tau_{\Delta t} = \Big(2\Delta t y' +\frac{\Delta t^3 y^{(3)}}{3} +\frac{\Delta t^5 y^{(5)}}{60} \Big) \div 2\Delta t - \lambda \Big( \frac{y}{3} + \frac{\Delta t^2 y''}{6} + \frac{\Delta t^4 y^{(4)}}{72} + \frac{2y}{3} \Big) $$ $$<=> \tau_{\Delta t} = y' +\frac{\Delta t^2 y^{(3)}}{6} +\frac{\Delta t^4 y^{(5)}}{120} - \lambda y - \frac{\lambda \Delta t^2 y''}{6} - \frac{\lambda \Delta t^4 y^{(4)}}{72} $$ grouping powers of $ \Delta t $  
 $$ \tau_{\Delta t} = (y' - \lambda y) + \Delta t^2(\frac{y^{(3)}}{6} - \frac{\lambda y''}{6}) + \Delta t^4(\frac{y^{(5)}}{120}  - \frac{\lambda y^{(4)}}{72}) + H.O.T.$$ this is where im stuck.

"I am trying to find the length of of the repeating block of digits in the decimal expansion of $\frac{17}{78}$. 
 On similar problems, that has not been an issue. Take for instance $\frac{17}{380}$. My usual approach would be to calculate $\Phi (380) = \Phi(4)*\Phi(5)*\Phi(19)=2*4*18=144$, then test $10^{\Phi(each factor)} \equiv 1 \pmod{380}$. No $\Phi(factor)$ passes, so the highest, $\Phi(19) = 18$, is the length of the repeating block of digits. 
 But that does not work for $\frac{17}{78}$. I know from checking on my calculator that the length is 6, but there is no factor of 78 such that $\Phi(factor)=6$.

"Suppose  $n$  (hat wearing) people attended a meeting. Afterwards, everyone took a hat at random. On the way home, there is a probability  $p$  that a person loses their hat (independent of whether other people did). What's the probability that nobody got home with their own hat? 
 First of all, I'm not sure if I got the question right. The way I understand it, we're interested in all of the following outcomes: 
 -Nobody got their own hat from the meeting. Then whether they lost it or not is irrelevant. 
 -Exactly one person got their own hat from the meeting but lost it on the way home. 
 -Exactly two people got their own hats from the meeting but lost it on the way home. 
 -... 
 -Everyone got their own hat from the meeting but they all lost it. 
 These events are disjoint so to get the probability of their union, I can just sum them up, right? So  $P(A)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} P(B_i)p^i$ , where  $B_i$  is the event that exactly  $i$  people got their hat from the meeting. 
 Therefore all that is left is to calculate  $P(B_i)$ . This is the amount of permutations with  $i$  fixed points divided by total amount of permutations of an  $n$ -element set, so 
 $$P(B_i)=\frac{D_{n,i}}{n!}$$ 
 where  $D_{n,i}$  is the  Rencontres  number,  $D_{n,i} = {n \choose i}D_{n-i,0}$ , so 
 $$P(B_i)=\frac{D_{n,i}}{n!} = \frac{{n \choose i}(n-i)!\sum_{k=0}^{n-i}\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}}{n!} = \frac{1}{i!} \sum_{k=0}^{n-i}\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}.$$ 
 Therefore,
 $$P(A)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} P(B_i)p^i = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \left( \frac{1}{i!} \sum_{k=0}^{n-i}\frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \right) p^i = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \left( \frac{p^i}{i!} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-i}\frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \right) \right)$$

I see that $|f(x,y)|\in \mathcal{M}^+(\mathbb{R}^2,\mathbb{B}_2)$, so i use Tonelli's theorem of integration w.r.t a product measure. 
 $$
\int |f(x,y)| d m_2(x,y) =\int \left(  \int|f(x,y)| dm(y)\right) dm(x)
$$
I continue to calculate, and end up with the inner integral giving $+\infty$, so by intuition i would say that integrating infinity over $\mathbb{R}^+$ is again infinity, Thus the function will not be integrable. 
 The problem is i dont know how to handle this situation stringent and make a valid argument that its not integrable, since i dont know what to do then the integrand becomes infinite. 
 Any help on how to handle a situation like this would be appreciated.

"Since I have not found any formula for this, I've written a quick Python script to calculate the number of numbers that can be expressed as  $x^2$  that are  $\le2^{30}$ , just to see the result. 
 It took a little while to compute, and it returned  $32769$ . Wolframalpha says that  $32769$  can be represented as  $2^{15} + 1$ , but I am still not seeing any pattern here. 
 EDIT : The script started from  $0$ , which explains the extra  $+1$ . The actual number of perfect squares that are  $\le2^{30}$  is  $2^{15} = 32768$ . 
 Also, thanks to  Eevee Trainer , I've been able to solve this more efficiently for  $x^2$ ,  $x^3$  and  $x^5$  using their formula: 
 $\text{# of positive perfect k-th powers less than or equal to n} = \lfloor \sqrt[k] n \rfloor$ 
 Therefore, these are the number of numbers that are less than or equal to  $2^{30}$  for each of the following types:

 cubes:  $\sqrt[3] {2^{30}} = 2^{10}$

We roll all three of these dice, and denote by  $X$  the sum of the three numbers that are showing. Find the expected value  $X$ . 
 My Attempt:  I have a hunch that the indicator approach might somehow work here but I do not see how to execute it.

"Some mathematical truth statements/questions can not be answered with certainty. This could be because 
 
 The computation required to answer them is finite but requires a universe-sized computer to work on it for longer than the age of the universe.  
 The question has an answer, but the computation required to answer them is infinite, so that they can never be answered. (I'd like to know an example of this). 
 Godel's theorem??? (despite reading a lot on this, I still don't fully understand what it means).  
 
 But my question is: Are there examples of problems that are not solvable in an exact way, but where we nevertheless have some exact algorithm that gives us a meaningful probability distribution over answers to the problem? 
 For example, we could have a function $f:X \to \{\text{yes,no} \}$, and a function $g:X\to [0,1]$, where we know that $f$ is fully defined for every $x\in X$, but we cannot compute it (or it takes a long time to compute so that we can only compute it for say 100 values in a year with a super computer), and where if we calculate $g(x)$ for various $x$, it will on average make meaningful probability statements about what the value of $f(x)$ is. It could be that while $f$ is computationally intractable, $g$ is very efficient.   
 Is there an example vaguely like this? (it doesn't have to fit my exact formulation).  
 To be clear, I'm not asking for ""approximations"" to $f$, but specifically for probability distributions over answers of $f$.   I am also not asking for an approximate probability distribution  to another probability distribution . I'm asking for a probability distribution over  mathematical truth statements  that while they may not be computable have an actual true answer. 
 
 Edit:  The Prime Number Theorem is a very good example. I am also wondering if there are any good examples of theorems that are unproven, but where there is nevertheless some sort of probability estimate possible regarding whether it's true or not. (I've read something regarding the Goldbach conjecture  here , but the argument seems obviously wrong).

"I have a circle of known radius $R$, and I have three arbitrary points defined around a circle at angles $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$, and $\phi_3$. In the figure below the red circles are the locations of the $\phi_i$ angles, the black circle is the circles origin, the blue line is the circle, and the dashed yellow lines are the chords between the locations of the phi angles (let's call these $D_{12}$, $D_{23}$, and $D_{31}$) 
 Plot of Circle 
 Now I am going to choose an arbitrary point, that is relatively close to the origin called $(x_0,y_0)$. I don't know exactly what this point it, but I do know the angles this new point makes with the $\phi$ locations (we can call these the $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, and $\theta_{31}$ angles). I want to eventually get to figuring out the $(x_0,y_0)$ value, but the first step is to calculate (with law of cosines) the lengths from each $\phi$ location to the $(x_0,y_0)$ point (we can call these $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$). 
 So this gives me an equation set like this: 
 $D_{12}^2 = L_1^2 + L_2^2 - 2L_1L_2cos(\theta_{12})$ 
 $D_{23}^2 = L_2^2 + L_3^2 - 2L_2L_3cos(\theta_{23})$ 
 $D_{31}^2 = L_3^2 + L_1^2 - 2L_3L_1cos(\theta_{31})$ 
 So just to summarize, I know $D_{12}$, $D_{23}$, $D_{31}$, $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, and $\theta_{31}$. I want to determine $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$. Now this is trivial if I just do a binomial expansion and assume $\frac{L_i}{R^2} \approx (1+2\frac{\delta_i}{R})$ where $L_i \approx R + \delta_i$. Then I can solve this linearly. 
 I realize that if I want better accuracy than a linear-ish approximation this is only solvable iteratively. What I would like is an algorithm that solves this set of equations in single precision math with guaranteed numerical stability (i.e. I know that no matter what I guess initially...or even if I guess the linear solution, the algorithm converges to the real solution and not infinity). Is this possible? 
 And just so you know where I am going with this, it is a really easy calculation from here to get to the $(x_0,y_0)$ positions

"If the rate at which something grows is proportional to itself, then you would call it exponential growth. Don't quote me on this, but I think it has something of the form  $y = e^x$ . 
 Now take for example this. If you want to calculate the volume of a sphere, the formula is  $v = 4/3 π r^3$  . The derivative with respect to the radius is  $dv/dr = 4πr^2$ . This shows the rate of change of the volume with respect to the radius. 
 Yet the volume of the sphere is proportional to the radius, which in turn defines the size of the sphere. The rate at which the volume of the sphere increases is proportional to itself in a way. Intuitively, I would expect to find somewhere in there an exponential yet there isn't. Why is that?

"For  $x \neq 1$ : 
 
 every  $“\cdots x1x\cdots“$  gives +1 pt 
 every  $“\cdots x11x\cdots“$  gives +5 pts. 
 every  $“\cdots x111x\cdots“$  gives +10 pts. 
 And so on:  $n$  consecutive 1’s gives us  $(n-1)5$  points. 
 
 To make it clear, the usual 6-sided dice is rolled 100 times, so for example if player rolls dice 1 time - there’s 1/6 chance of getting 1 point; rolls two times - then there’s  $\frac{1}{6}\frac{5}{6}2$  chance of 1 point(“1x” or “x1”) and  $\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2$  of getting 5 points(only if “11” rolled out).
 The question:  what is the mean score after rolling dice  100  times? 
 The problem is: how do we calculate the mean when the number of rolls is so huge? It’s clear that using definition of the mean directly is not an option because number of different configurations for getting any score is immense(only if that score is not, say, 99*5 which require all the 1’s). 
 I tried to use induction, but it didn’t worked out, for 3-4 rolls it already gets complicated. Moreover, how am I suppose to use it? If I know mean for &n& rolls and then I add  $(n+1)$ th roll - it will add 0, 1 or 5 points depending on which number rolled in  $n$ th place. Seems like knowing mean for  $n$  rolls won’t be much of a help because after one more roll chance of getting any score is different. 
 Another idea given to me by roommate is to fix number of ones that we get in entire 100-length sequence(so probability is fixed as well), and see what number of points we can possibly get with that number of 1’s - to know that these numbers will appear in formula for mean with known probability factor. But I’m not sure about that also because the amount of combinations is still insane. 
 I ran out of ideas for now. Feels like there must be some efficient, less bloody way to calculate all that because our teacher gave us only 40 minutes for that problem (and another one), which completely freaked me out. All I wanted to say - I really appreciate any of your help since I absolutely have to figure this out.

$$\omega\left(t+dt\right)=\omega\left(t\right)-\frac{g}{r}\sin\left[\theta\left(t+dt\right)\right]dt$$ 
 Assuming a small initial amplitude, the period of oscillation is 
 $$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{r}{g}}$$ 
 Here is the python code I came up with, which works well 
 from numpy import *

file = open('task15.txt', 'w')
file.write(""time"" + ""\t"" + ""theta"" + ""\t"" + ""omega"" + ""\n"")

t = 0.0
tmax = 20.0
dt = 0.1
theta = 0.1
omega = 0.0
while (t <= tmax):

    theta += omega * dt
    omega -= sin(theta) * dt     #choose units such that (g/r) = 1
    file.write(str(t) + ""\t"" + str(theta) + ""\t"" + str(omega) ""\n"")
    t += dt

file.close()
exit()
 
 By plotting the amplitude as a function of time, I have found graphically that the period asymptotically increases from the expected value (given above) as the initial amplitude increases, because the small angle approximation no longer holds. 
 I would like to update the code so it can calculate the period, although I'm not sure how to do this explicitly. 
 Somehow I need to create a user-defined function which returns the time when $\theta$ changes sign. Can I do this using the while loop? Then the difference between two successive times is half the period. 
 Can someone push me in the right direction with an algorithm and/or code? Thanks in advance.

"I have a cable winch system that I would like to know how much cable is left given the number of rotations that have occurred and vice versa. This system will run on a low-cost microcontroller with low computational resources and should be able to update quickly, long for/while loop iterations are not ideal. 
 The inputs are cable diameter, inner drum diameter, inner drum width, and drum rotations. The output should be the length of the cable on the drum. 
 At first, I was calculating the maximum number of wraps of cable per layer based on cable diameter and inner drum width, I could then use this to calculate the length of cable per layer. The issue comes when I calculate the total length as I have to loop through each layer, a costly operation (could be 100's of layers). 
 My next approach was to precalculate a table with each layer, then perform a 3-5 degree polynomial regression down to an easy to calculate formula. 
 This appears to work for the most part, however, there are slight inaccuracies at the low and high end (0 rotations could be + or - a few units of cable length). The real issue comes when I try and reverse the function to get the current rotations of the drum given the length. So far, my reversed formula does not seem to equal the forward formula (I am reversing X and Y before calculating the polynomial). 
 I have looked high and low and cannot seem to find any formulas for cable length to rotations that do not use recursion or loops. I can't figure out how to reverse my polynomial function to get the reverse value without losing precision. If anyone happens to have an insight/ideas or can help guide me in the right direction that would be most helpful. Please see my attempts below.

WrapsPerLayer = DrumWidth / CableDiameter

While CurrentLength < CableLength // Calcuate layer length for each layer up to cable length
  CableStackHeight = CableDiameter * CurrentLayer
  DrumDiameterAtLayer = DrumDiameter + (CableStackHeight * 2) // Assumes cables stack vertically
  WrapDiameter = DrumDiameterAtLayer + CableDiameter // Center point of cable
  WrapLength = WrapDiameter * PI
  LayerLength = WrapLength * WrapsPerLayer
  
  CurrentRotations += WrapsPerLayer // 1 Rotation per wrap
  CurrentLength += LayerLength
  CurrentLayer++
  
  PolyRotations.Push(CurrentRotations)
  PolyLengths.Push(CurrentLength)
  PolyLayers.Push(CurrentLayer)

End


// Using 5 degree polynomials, any lower = very low precision

PolyLengthToRotation = CreatePolynomial(PolyLengths, PolyRotations, 5) // 5 Degrees
PolyRotationToLength = CreatePolynomial(PolyRotations, PolyLengths, 5) // 5 Degrees

// 40 Rotations should equal about 3141.593 units
RealRotation = 40
RealLength = 3141.593
CalculatedLength = EvaluatePolynomial(RealRotation,PolyRotationToLength)
CalculatedRotations = EvaluatePolynomial(RealLength,PolyLengthToRotation)

// CalculatedLength = 3141.593 // Good

"I have heard people say that you can't (or shouldn't) use the L'Hopital's rule to calculate $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin x}x=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\cos x=1$, because the result $\frac d{dx}\sin x=\cos x$ is derived by using that limit. 
 But is that opinion justified? Why should I be vary of applying L'Hopital's rule to that limit? 
 I don't see any problem with it. The sine function fulfills the conditions of the L'Hopital's  rule. 
 Also, it is a fact that the derivative of sine is cosine, no matter how we proved it. Certainly there is a way to prove $\frac d{dx}\sin x=\cos x$ without using the said limit (if someone knows how, they can post it) so we don't even have any circular logic. Even if there isn't,  $\frac d{dx}\sin x=\cos x$ was proven sometime without referencing the L'Hopital's rule so we know it is true. Why wouldn't we then freely apply the L'Hopital's rule to $\frac {\sin x}x$? 
 PS I'm not saying that this is the best method to derive the limit or anything, but that I don't understand why it is so frowned upon and often considered invalid.

 There are more parts to this question, but I figured that I will deal with them when I understand the basic concepts better. So these are my questions:

"I'm planning vacations with a group of friends (12 people), and it involves a ~1200km return trip by car. Only one of us owns a suitable car (4 pax), so we've rented a minivan to transport the other 8, and we're debating on how best to share the costs. 
 Normally, if none of the cars were rentals, each car owner would just  divide the price of fuel and tolls  over their passengers, themselves included. 
 Logically, we could do the same with the rental fees. But as a passenger who could either be in the personal car or in the rented minivan, their share of the cost will be vastly different depending on which car they end up in, for the same trip. That would be  unfair to the passengers of the rental car . 
 We could also share the sum of all fees of both cars across all of us. But that would be  unfair to the car owner , who ends up paying a higher trip cost than if it were just his car and passengers sharing the cost, despite owning a car and enduring the associated hassles and yearly expenses. 
 If we calculate it that way, we need to include the  full, actual cost to him  of using his car for the trip, including maintenance, amortization, and insurance. 
 What would be the best way to share these costs?

 The fund earns an annual nominal interest rate of $8 \%$ compounded monthly.

"I know that I already asked this kind of question on the website, but meanwhile I have much more knowledge about the subject and ready to describe my real problem with enough background information I hope. 
 
 Assume we are given a system  
 $$\dot x= Ax + Bu $$ $$y = Cx + Du $$ where $A,B,C,D$ are matrices, and $x, u$ and $y$ are vectors with appropriate sizes 
 
 I wrote an article about calculating the  poles  and  zeros  of such a system.  
 First of all we can calculate the  transfer function  of the system, which is
$$H(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B$$ 
 Then I put $H(s)$ in the  Smith-McMillan form.  All elements are rationals of the form: $\frac{\epsilon_i(s)}{\psi_i(s)}$.
$$ SM_H(s) = 
  \left( \begin{array}{cccc|ccc}
    \frac{\epsilon_1(s)}{\psi_1(s)} & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
    0 & \frac{\epsilon_2(s)}{\psi_2(s)} & 0 & \vdots & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
    \vdots &  & \ddots & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
    0 & \ldots & 0 & \frac{\epsilon_r(s)}{\psi_r(s)} & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\              \hline
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
  \end{array} \right) $$ 
 Then, the definitions of poles and zeros. We have that the poles of a transfer function matrix are the roorts of the polynomial $p_H(s)$:  $$ p_H(s) = \psi_1(s)\psi_2(s)\ldots\psi_r(s)$$ 
 The following theorem is presented: The controllable eigenvalues are the poles of $H(s)$. 
$$ \{ \textrm{Poles of } H(s) \} \subseteq \{ \textrm{Eigenvalues of } A \}$$ 
 And then, for the several types of zeros of a given system, we defined a system matrix P(s):  
 $$P(s) = \left[
                \begin{array}{cc}
                  sI-A & B \\
                  -C & D \\
                \end{array} \right]
 $$ 
 where The $\textbf{zeros of the system $\{A,B,C,D\}$}$ are the roots of the zero polynomial $z_P(s)$ of the system. $z_P(s)$ is the monic greatest common divisor of all nonzero minors of order $r =  \text{Rank }P(s)$. 
 And so on and so on. For example we defined invariant  zeros, input-decoupling zeros, output-decoupling zeros, input/output decoupling zeros  and finally the  zeros of the transfer function  $H(s)$. They had all specific properties, like the zeros of a transfer function correspond with  
 
 So, that was a lot of information I think. But now I come to the point: I have just 2 questions for you about this theory. 
 
 What is the whole motivation of this theory?  Why are we calculation the poles and zeros of systems? I know that eigenvalues are important because the eigenvalues give us information about stability, controllability, stabilizeability etc. But can you guys give me about 3 reasons to calculate poles and all those different types of zeros? 
 What exactly is a transfer function and why is it important?  I know that it has something to do with relation between input and output of all the indivual states, and that the Laplace Transformation is somehow involved (Which I never learned, but if you can give me a introductionary website/pdf about Laplace let me know!)

 Calculate:
 $$\lim _{x\to \infty }\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^3+4}+\sin \left(x\right)}{\sqrt{x^3+2x^2+7x+11}}\right)$$ 
 
 Here's my attempt: 
 I first tried to the statement up. I first let  $f(x)=\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^3+4}+\sin \left(x\right)}{\sqrt{x^3+2x^2+7x+11}}\right)$ ,  $f_1(x)=\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^3+4}}{\sqrt{x^3+2x^2+7x+11}}\right)$  and  $f_2(x)=\left(\frac{\sin \left(x\right)}{\sqrt{x^3+2x^2+7x+11}}\right)$ . We know that  $\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x)=\lim_{x \to \infty}f_1(x)+\lim_{x \to \infty}f_2(x)$ . Now we can find the limit of  $f_1(x)$  and  $f_2(x)$ , which will give us our solution.Therefore, we have: 
 \begin{align}
\lim_{x \to \infty}f_1(x)&=\lim_{x \to \infty}\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^3+4}}{\sqrt{x^3+2x^2+7x+11}}\right)\\ 
&= {\sqrt{\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^{3} + 4}{x^{3} + 2 x^{2} + 7 x + 11}}} \\
&= \sqrt{\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1 + \frac{4}{x^{3}}}{1 + \frac{2}{x} + \frac{7}{x^{2}} + \frac{11}{x^{3}}}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{\lim_{x \to \infty}\left(1 + \frac{4}{x^{3}}\right)}{\lim_{x \to \infty}\left(1 + \frac{2}{x} + \frac{7}{x^{2}} + \frac{11}{x^{3}}\right)}} \\
&= \ ... \\
&= 1
\end{align} 
 \begin{align}
\lim_{x \to \infty}f_2(x)&=\lim_{x \to \infty}\left(\frac{\sin \left(x\right)}{\sqrt{x^3+2x^2+7x+11}}\right) \\
&= \ ... \\
&= 0
\end{align} 
 For the limit of  $f_2(x)$ , I left out the actuall working out but you can either use the squeeze theorem or the fact that since  $\sin(x)$  is divergent and the denominator converges to  $0$ , which means that the overall function will also converge to  $0$ . According to the Squeeze Theorem, since  $- \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{3} + 2 x^{2} + 7 x + 11}} \leq \frac{\sin{\left(x \right)}}{\sqrt{x^{3} + 2 x^{2} + 7 x + 11}} \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{3} + 2 x^{2} + 7 x + 11}}$  and both the functions on the left and right converge to  $0$ , so does  $f_2(x)$ . 
 Therefore:  $$\lim _{x\to \infty }\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^3+4}+\sin \left(x\right)}{\sqrt{x^3+2x^2+7x+11}}\right)=1$$ 
 However, I'm not sure if this is  $100%$  since neither Symbolab nor EMathHelp could determine the solution.

"I find  Implicit function theorem  (limited to scalar function) both fascinating and a bit puzzling. Simply said, total derivative of some  $f(x,y(x))$  according to  $x$  is: 
 $$ \frac{d f(x,y(x)) }{ dx } = f_{x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial x} + f_{y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = 0$$ 
 It is straight forward to see, that such total derivative of  $f(x,y(x))$  can be expressed through partial derivative: 
 $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = - \frac{f_{x}(x, y(x))}{f_{y}(x,y(x))} \tag {1}$$ 
 where for brevity  $f_{x} = \frac{\partial f(x,y(y))}{\partial x}$  and  $f_{y} = \frac{\partial f(x,y(y))}{\partial y}$ 
 So far, so good . Now lets try to continue by taking partial derivative with respect to  $y$ . This can naturally happen when one needs to evaluate implicit function  $f(x,y(x))$  for variable  $y$  at variable  $x$ , it's first derivative  $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$  and naturally one would expect second derivative  $\frac{\partial ^2 y}{\partial ^2 x}$  and  $\frac{\partial ^2 y}{\partial x \partial y}$  to exist, e.g. for calculating Hessian matrix. 
 Case 1: apply quotient rule on {1} 
 One could blindly do the following in order to obtain  $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$  to get  $\frac{\partial ^2 y}{\partial x \partial y}$ : 
 $$\frac{\partial ^2 y}{\partial x \partial y} = - \frac{\partial (\frac{f_{x}}{f_{y}})}{\partial y}$$  which holds, if higher derivatives of  $f_x$  and  $f_y$  exists. 
 Case 2: analyze where the expression becomes constant 
 Obviously  $\frac{\partial y}{\partial y} = 1$ . This happens within  $\frac{\partial ^2 y}{\partial y \partial x}$  and since  $\frac{\partial ^2 y}{\partial x \partial y} = \frac{\partial ^2 y}{\partial y \partial x}$ , then it is expected to happen for any mixed second-order partial derivative. 
 This way, one should have always  $\frac{\partial ^2 y}{\partial y \partial x} = 0$  for an implicit function, since deriving  $\frac{\partial y}{\partial y} = 1$  is the derivation of a constant, thus 0. 
 Question 
 Which of the 2 cases is wrong and why? 
 More details 
 To provide more details, but still keep the question general, lets assume the form of  $f(x,y(x))$ , to provide some  visual clues . 
 $$f(x,y(x)) = e^{(x+y)} + x + y = 0$$ 
 Background  (to give the equations intuitive motivation related to experimental observations) 
 Variables  $x$  and  $y$  are physical quantities (current, voltage).  $f(x,y(x)) = 0$ , thus this function is used to evaluate the quantities  $x$  and  $y$  only. For instance, I need the value of  $y$  for  $x=c$ , then I evaluate  $f(c,y) = 0$  to get  $y$ . This also means, that when one variable changes (e.g.  $x$ ) then  $y$  changes as well. Therefore, when I calculate derivatives, then naturally I take  $\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}$ , because that is what I observe as a derivative at the level of the physical system (e.g. lowering current, rises the voltage). This means, that in the Jacobian and Hessian I expect to see  $\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}$ , rather than  $\frac{\partial f(x,y(x))}{\partial y}$ .

"So basically the question goes:
Let $ABC$ be a triangle and that $\cos A=-\frac 3 5$ and $\cos B=\frac 5 {13}$, find $\cos C$. 
What I did was I get the value of $A$ and $B$ by calculating the arccosine of $-3/5$ and $5/13$ and the sum of both of these angles was already greater than $180$, how can I calculate $\cos C$?

"I'm working on the following. 
 Ten objects shall be arranged in two queues of equal length. The order matters. 
 a) A and B must be in different queues. 
 b) A and B must be next to each other in the same queue. 
 Objects =  $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J$ 
 Queues =  $1,2$ 
 a)
If we first place A, then there are 10 possible positions. If we then place B, then there are 5 possible positions. Then we will place the other eight objects in 8 possible positions. Then the same thing, but B is placed first, then A. 
 $$10\cdot 5 \cdot \binom{8}{8} \cdot 2=4032000$$ 
 But if we place all then objects without restraints, we get a lower number. What am I doing wrong?

 b) Calculate if A and B are next to each other in 1. Then the same thing for 2.

 I am wondering if is it possible state a similar asymptotic, for twin primes on assumption of the Twin Prime conjecture as I've said in previous paragraph, studied by Rubinstein and Sarnak. The identity that I am saying appears for example in page 221 of  Granville and Martin,  Carreras de números primos , La Gaceta de la Real Sociedad Matemática Española, Vol 8.1 (2005)  (in spanish, there is a version in english edited with title  Prime Number Races  from the American Mathematical Monthly, at 2006). 
 I believe that this question is not in the literature but maybe is related to the calculation in the Apéndice II of previous paper from La Gaceta. 
 
 Question.  We assume previous Twin Prime conjecture and we imagine that our purpose should be write a similar statement for twin primes than Sarnak and Rubinstein wrote for prime numbers. Then I believe that the first step should be: 
 Calculate the asymptotic behaviour of
 $$\sum_{x\leq X:\pi_2(x)<2C_2\int_2^x\frac{dt}{\log^2t}}\frac{1}{x},$$  as  $X\to\infty$ . Can you provide the calculations or hints to get this asymptotic behaviour?

"Ok so on doing a whole lot of Geometry Problems, since I am weak at Trigonometry, I am now focused on  $2$  main questions :-

 Some Information  :- This site :-  https://www.intmath.com/blog/mathematics/how-do-you-find-exact-values-for-the-sine-of-all-angles-6212  , produces a clear understanding and a detailed approach of finding the  $\sin$  of any angle from  $1$  to  $90^\circ$  , and I found it very interesting. But now the Questions arise :- 
 Can you find the  $\sin$ ,  $\cos$  or  $\tan$  of any fraction angles, like  $39.67$ ?  
Can you find the  $\sin$ ,  $\cos$  or  $\tan$  of recurring fractions like  $\frac{47}{9}$ ?  
Can you find the  $\sin$ ,  $\cos$  or  $\tan$  of irrationals, like  $\sqrt{2}?$ 
 Since I am a bit new to Trigonometry, I will be asking if there is a formula to find the  $\sin$  of fractions, or even recurring fractions. I can use the calculator to find them obviously, but I have another Question :- 
 $2)$   How to calculate the trigonometric ratios of every angle in fractional form? 
 We all know  $\sin 45^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$  , but what will be  $\sin 46^\circ$  in fractions? I can use a calculator to calculate the decimal of it, but it is hard to deduce the fraction out of the value, especially because the decimal will be irrational. I know how to convert recurring decimals to fractions, but this is not the case. Right now I am focused on a particular problem, which asks me to find the  $\sin$  of a recurring fraction, in a fraction form. I am struggling to do this unless I clear up the ideas. 
 Edit : My problem is to find the  $\sin$  of  $\frac{143}{3}^\circ$  . I do not have any specific formula to find this, and I am mainly stuck here. I need a formula which shows how this can be done.

"I've come into contact with this two part question, and the latter I'm not too sure how to go about; at least to me upon researching, I can't find anything remotely similar to what I've been asked. 
 The question is as follows: 
 a) Show that  $$\mathcal L\left[\int_{0}^t f(\tau)d\tau\right] = \frac1p\mathcal L[f(t)]$$ 
 this I had no problem with, and was able to prove easily. The following part is what I'm struggling with. 
 b)  Hence , calculate the LT of the so-called Fresnel integrals defined as follows: 
 $$C(t) = \int_{0}^t \frac{\cos(\tau)}{\sqrt{2\pi\tau}}d\tau $$  and 
 $$S(t) = \int_{0}^t \frac{\sin(\tau)}{\sqrt{2\pi\tau}}d\tau $$ 
 I assumed to use the above identity (given the choice of  hence  in the question), and applying this, have ended up with: 
 $$ \frac1{p\sqrt{2\pi}}\mathcal L\big(\frac{\cos{t}}{\sqrt{t}}\big)$$ 
 and  $$ \frac1{p\sqrt{2\pi}}\mathcal L\big(\frac{\sin{t}}{\sqrt{t}}\big)$$ 
 From here, I've hit a brick wall; I've tried looking in various tables, and other LT methods, but I can't seem to find one that will do the trick here. I'm not too sure how to deal with the remaining Laplace transforms I'm left with. 
 Any small hints / tips to put me back on track would be much appreciated!! 
 EDIT 
After using Robert's and jmerry's hints, I now have: 
 $$\mathcal L \left[C(t)\right] = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4p} \left( \frac1{\sqrt{p-i}}+\frac1{\sqrt{p+i}}\right) $$ 
 $$\mathcal L \left[S(t)\right] = \frac{-i\sqrt{2}}{4p} \left( \frac1{\sqrt{p-i}}-\frac1{\sqrt{p+i}}\right) $$ 
as my result for C(t) and S(t).

"Given $f(x, y) = x$ and $X$ is defined as $2rx \leq x^2 + y^2 \leq R^2$ and $0 < 2r < R$.  
 Calculate $\int \int_X f(x, y)dxdy$. 
 So $x^2 + y^2 \leq R^2$ is an area inside a circle with radius $R$.  
 $2rx \leq x^2 + y^2$ and $0 < 2r < R$ give us a second circle, which  area depends on value of $x$ with center on somewhere on $(0, R)$, the leftest coordinate on $(0, 0)$ and the rightest on $(x_1, 0)$, where $x_1 < R$.  
 So the area of the integral is area of a big circle minus the area of a small circle. 
 Now let's denote the area of a big circle as $X_1: (x, y)| - R \leq x \leq R; -\sqrt{x} \leq y \leq \sqrt{x}$. 
 Small circle $X_2: (x, y) | 0 \leq x \leq 2r; -\sqrt{x(x - r)} \leq y \leq 
\sqrt{x(x - 2r)}$  
 I'm not quite sure about the bounds, especially of the small circle, so it may be some mistake here. Unfortunately I'm unable to find it. 
 Then $\int \int_{X_1} x = \int \limits_{-R}^{R} dx \int \limits_{-\sqrt{x}}^{\sqrt{x}} x dy = \int \limits^R_{-R}xdx\int \limits_{-\sqrt{x}}^{\sqrt{x}}dy = 2 \int \limits_{-R}^{R} x^{\frac{3}{2}} dx = \frac{4}{5}\left(R^{\frac{5}{2}} - \left(-R \right)^{\frac{5}{2}}\right)$. 
 And now I'm stuck on calculate the area of a small circle. 
 Also can somebody check the bounds which I found for $X_1$ and $X_2$, since it might be the reason I'm unable evaluate second integral.

 Find the Fourier series for  $f$ :

 I tried to linearize  $f(x)$  using the following formulas:

 Initially I thought it would be  $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ , since if I consider the number  $1$ , its neighbour distances can vary from  $1$  to  $(n-1)$  (average  $n/2$ ) and there are ( $n-1$ ) total neighbours.

"Consider two circles with a diameter equal to $a$, externally tangent to each other, and whose centers are at the same height. Those circles are inscribed inside a rectangle of length $2a$ and height $a$. This is a sketch I made for this problem (please, forgive my unsteady handwriting): 
 
 I am asked to calculate the shaded area.
I can do it using: 
 
 Symmetry.  This is the easiest way in my opinion, since we know the area of each circle ($\pi a^2/4$) and the area of the rectangle ($2a^2$), which gives us: $\boxed{A_{\text{shaded}}=\dfrac{4-\pi}{4} a^2}$ 
 Mathematical functions.  We can set the origin at the bottom left corner, calculate each of the circles' analytical functions (as well as that of the line), compute the intersections, and make use of definite integrals to compute the final area. It will yield the exact same result as the above, yet the process to achieve it would be much longer. 
 
 However, I'm not interested in any of these 2 methods (as they look pretty easy). I'm interested in finding a pure geometrical way to solve it. No functions. No symmetry as I used above. But pure geometric relationships. 
 I thought about drawing some lines from the center of each circle to each intersection, like this: 
 
 This would give us 4 areas hopefully easy to solve for ($S_1$, $S_1^{\prime\prime}$ and $S_2$, $S_2^{\prime\prime}$). Of course, $S_1=S_1^{\prime\prime}$ and $S_2=S_2^{\prime\prime}$ but as I said,  I don't want to make use of symmetry  (I'm a bit masochistic after all). So I thought about this solving scheme: 
 
 $A_{\text{shaded}}=\frac12A_{\text{rectangle}}-S_2-(A_{\text{circle}}-S_2^{\prime\prime})$ 
 $A_{\text{sector}}=S_1+S_2$ 
 Since $S_1$ is a triangle, we could use some trigonometric relations in it to solve for $S_1$, and since the area of a circular sector is known, we could solve for $S_2$ (and $S_2^{\prime\prime}$, and very innocently find that actually $S_2=S_2^{\prime\prime}$) 
 
 The main problem I have is that I don't know the inner angle of the circle sectors, because of the (seemingly randomly placed) intersection points near the borders of the rectangle. 
 IF ONLY  I were able to locate those intersection points using pure trigonometry and geometric relationships/theorems, the problem could be solved. 
 Any hints or ideas? 
 PD:  Please, don't question my (foolish) decision of not making use of symmetry. I want to take this problem as a personal challenge. Obviously, if this were to be solved quickly I wouldn't scratch my head too much and go for the easy solution.

(Source:  https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/885243624933400577 ) 
 The rules are: 
 
 The password must contain $9$ numbers (and only $9$ numbers) 
 It must include at least $4$ different numbers 
 It cannot include the same number more than three times 
 
 I understand the basic permutations will be $10^9$ ($0-9$ nine times) $= 1,000,000,000$ 
 What I don't understand is how you factor in the reduction in permutations by enforcing $4$ different numbers and limiting repeats to $3$.

 The time until failure, T, of a product is modeled by a uniform distribution on $[0, 10]$.  An extended warranty pays a benefit of $100$ if failure occurs between time $t = 1.5$ and $t = 8$. 
 The present value, $W$, of this benefit is 
 $$
W = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
    0, & 0 \leq T < 1.5, \\
    100e^{-0.04T}, & 1.5 \leq T < 8, \\
    0, & 8 \leq T \leq 10.
\end{array} \right.
$$ 
 Calculate $P(W < 79)$. 
 
 This problem we were doing in class and the argument was as follows 
 $$ P(W<79) = P(W < 79 | 0 \leq T < 1.5) P(T < 1.5) + P(W < 79 | 1.5 \leq T < 8)P(1.5 \leq T <8 ) + P(W<79| 8 \leq T \leq 10 ) P(8 \leq T \leq 10 ) $$ 
 MY question is, why do we have to break in such a cases? This was done by using the law of total probability? 
 Secondly, can we say 
 $$ P(W < 79 | 0 \leq T < 1.5) P(T < 1.5) = 0 $$ 
 since $W = 0 $ on this interval of $T$ ? Because when trying to compute this I get 
 $$ P(W < 79 | 0 \leq T < 1.5) P(T < 1.5)  =  P( \{W < 79 \} \cap\{0 \leq T \leq 1.5 \} ) =0 $$

  3 & -1 & 0 \\
  1 & 1 & -2 \\
  0 & 0 & 2
 \end{bmatrix}$ calculate the Jordan canonical form such that $F = T F_j T^{-1}$. 
 The characteristic polynomial is $ (\lambda -2)^3= 0$ so the eigenvalue is $\lambda = 2$ 
 The eigenvectors $v$ are given by $(F - \lambda I)v = 0$ so  $ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & 0 \\

 Now I need to calculate the kernel of $(F - \lambda I)^2$ 
 $(F - \lambda I)^2=\begin{bmatrix}

 $(F - \lambda I)^2 v_2 = 0$ so the kernel is $<\begin{bmatrix}

 \end{bmatrix} ><\begin{bmatrix}
  0  \\

 So far my calculations should be right but now come the problems. 
 The matrix $T $ should be $\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & x_1 \\
  0 & 1 & x_2 \\
  0 & 0 & x_3
 \end{bmatrix}$ where the third column is: 
 $(F - \lambda I) \begin{bmatrix}

  0 
 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}

  1 \\
  0 \\

 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}

"When I'm facing functions for which no formula exist to calculate the roots directly, what can I do with calculus to analyse it so that I can obtain information about the function's behavior? 
 Suppose that the function is $f(x) = e^{-x} + x^3$. The first thing that I'd check is whether the function changes its sign between $+\infty$ and $-\infty$. In this case it goes to $+\infty$ for both sides, so I can't guarantee the existance of roots relying on that alone. 
 The next step would be to take the derivatives. Calculating $f'''$ gives me that $f'''$ is monotone crescent and I can see that there is a root for that function. To find this root I can use Newton's method. 
 From there I'm kinda cluless about what to do with the information given by the third order derivative. I don't know how many times $0 = e^{-x} + x^3$ happen, is there a theorem to find this out?

"Backround: 
 I have been studying the peculiar function  $$Q(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{P_n(x)}{n(2n+1)}$$ 
where  $P_n(x)$  is the set of all polynomials with unit coefficients, defined by the binary expansion of  $n$ . For example
 $$n=57=\color{red}{111001}_2\iff P_n(x)=\color{red}{1}x^5+\color{red}{1}x^4+\color{red}{1}x^3+\color{red}{0}x^2+\color{red}{0}x^1+\color{red}{1}x^0.$$ 
 
 Some properties: 
 This function seems intimately tied with the  Euler-Mascheroni constant   $\gamma$ ,  $\pi$ , and the natural logarithm. For instance, with some algebraic manipulation of some of the ""easier"" values of  $n$ , we can find that
 $$Q(0)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(2n+1)(2(2n+1)+1)}=\frac{1}{4}(\pi-\ln(4)),$$ 
as  calculated by WolframAlpha , and
 $$Q(1)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{H(n)}{n(2n+1)}=\ln\left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)+\gamma,$$ 
where  $H(n)$  is the  Hamming weight  of the binary expansion of  $n$ , proven by combining some of the  series expansions of  $\gamma$ . 
 
 Questions: 
 Some questions arose while playing around with this function. 
 
 Can we find other ""interesting values"" of  $Q$ , for  $Q(-1)$ ,  $Q(2)$ ,  $Q\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ , for example? 
 Can we find a closed form of  $Q$ , in terms of other elementary / transcendental functions? Or at the very least, 
 the coefficients of its power series? 
 
 
 My work on its power series: 
 When it comes to its power series 
 $$Q(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^n,$$ 
 using properties of binary, we can deduce that.
 $$c_n = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \sum_{m = 2^n} ^ {2^{n + 1} - 1} \frac{1}{(2^{n + 1} k + m)(2(2^{n + 1} k + m) + 1)}.$$ 
Plugging in values of  $n=0,1,2$  into WolframAlpha, we find that
 $$c_0 = \frac{1}{4}(\pi-2\ln(2))\approx 0\approx 0.43883,$$ 
 $$c_1 = \frac{1}{8}(\pi (2\sqrt{2}-1) - 6\ln 2)\approx 0.19816,$$ 
 $$c_2 = \frac{1}{16}\left(\frac{\pi\left(-6-5\sqrt{2}+8\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}+4\sqrt{2(2+\sqrt{2})}\right)}{2+\sqrt{2}}-14\ln(2)\right)\approx 0.09301.$$ 
However I'm not sure what methods it used to calculate such, and if they can be used to generalize a closed form for any  $c_n$ . At the very least, my pattern recognition sees that  $c_n$  is of the form  $2^{-(n+2)}(A_n\pi - B_n \ln 2)$ , with  $A_n$  an algebraic number and  $B_n$  a natural number. 
 Any and all insight would be greatly appreciated.

"2015/01/28 Clarification: Question rewritten to remove ambiguity that elicited (interesting) responses to a different problem (use edit should you wish to view). 
 From Markus' feedback on the earlier question: 
 
 Let's consider a die with $F$ faces. This die is rolled $M$ times. What is the probability, that each window of size $N \leq M$ within this series of $M$ rolls contains always all $F$ faces? 
 
 Or alternatively, consider an urn with $F$ differently colored balls, where $M$ balls are drawn (with replacement after each draw) and the colors noted. What is the probability given $F$, $M$, and some $N \leq M$ that every consecutive $N$ draws of the $M$ total draws exhibited at least one example each of all $F$ colors? 
 Obviously, if $M<N$ or $N<F$ the probability is 0. I'm stuck for the $F\leq N \leq M$ cases. 
 I can do this using recursive calculation or a Markov chain, but only for the most trivial (small) cases, since the state space obviously explodes quite quickly. 
 I thought of treating it like a runs/streak problem, that is, I thought that if some face/color is seen, followed by $N$ all of differing face/color resulting in a ""failure"", I could just use existing means of calculating a streak of $N$ events with probability $(faces - 1)/(faces)$ for the event of a differing face/color. I was unable to arrive at a solution this way. 
 I then thought of treating it as a coupon collector's problem. I can easily calculate the probability of all faces/colors being seen in the first $N$, so I thought using that, the next ""window"" from 2 to N+1 is a ""failure"" if those $N$ are all different from the 1st element (probability $((faces - 1)/(faces))^N$), continuing this for each step of the ""window"" by 1 to get a net probability. I get stuck here with the dependency between successive ""windows"", and I'm not even sure if it's a valid tack. 
 I attempted to find a generating function by looking at actual example counts of differing cases, and searching OEIS for sequences along with checking for generating/sequence functions in  Mathematica . I found no matches, and I'm a neophyte with generating functions, so I hit a dead end there. 
 Bottom line, given $F, M, N$, how might I calculate this?  
 A couple of examples follow to clarify the above problem description. 
 Given an alphabet of two elements ${0,1}$, ($F=2$) the possible words of length 4 ($M=4$) are  
 
 With a ""window"" of 3 ($N=3$), the only length 4 words that have no missing alphabet elements in all possible length 3 ""windows"" are 
 
 So, my probability of missing some alphabet element in a 3-windowed 4-length string on a 2-element alphabet is 6/16. 
 For a more involved example, take the length 6 strings on $0,1,2,3$. There are 4096 of them (I'll not list them for obvious reasons). For a ""window"" of 5, only 528 of them have the complete alphabet in all possible length 5 consecutive positions. A few examples: 
 
 Note that in all of these, positions 1 through 5 and 2 through 6 for each have at least one example of every element in the alphabet. 
 That number (528 in this example, or equivalently 3568 for the complement) is what I'm after. 
 I hope that clarifies the question, apologies to readers for any confusion I caused.

"How can I calculate the minimum distance between a point on the perimeter of a disk in 3d space and a point above the disk? 
 For example, there is a disk in 3d space with center [0,0,0]. It has radius 3 and lies flat on the x,y plane. If there is a particle above the disk at [5,5,5], how do I calculate the minimum distance from this particle to a point on the perimeter of the disk? 
 
 Here is my attempt so far: 
 vec1 = vector between disk center and particle
vec1 = [(5 - 0), (5 - 0), (5 - 0)]
vec1 = [5,5,5]

unitvec1 = unit vector in direction of vec1
unitvec1 = vec1/norm(vec1)
unitvec1 = [0.5774, 0.5774, 0.5774]

vec2 = vector between disk center and point on the perimeter closest to the particle
vec2 = disk radius * unitvec1, and make z element = 0
vec2 = 3 * [0.5774, 0.5774, 0]
vec2 = [1.7321, 1.7321, 0]

vec3 = vector between particle and point on the perimeter closest to the particle
vec3 = vec1 - vec2
vec3 = [3.2679, 3.2679, 5.0000]

So the min distance is
norm(vec3) = 6.8087
 
 But this method doesn't always work. If I try it with disk center [0,0,0], particle location [0,0,6], and disk radius 9, it gives the minimum distance to be 6. this can't be correct, because the distance between the center of the disk and the particle will be 6, so the distance to the perimeter must be larger. 
 What am I doing wrong, and how should I actually calculate this? 
 Thanks!

"I want to calculate  $\mathbb{E}(X\vert Y=y)$  where  $X$  corresponds to the lower value of the two rolled dice and Y to the the higher value. 
 Here is what I managed to do: 
 I know that  $\mathbb{E}(X\vert Y=y) = \frac{\mathbb{E}(X[Y=y])}{\mathbb{P}(Y=y)}$ .
Now let  $X_1$  and  $X_2$  correspond to the rolled dice. Then I can write  $$X=min\{X_1,X_2\}~~~\text{and}~~~Y=max\{X_1,X_2\}.$$

 $$\mathbb{P}(Y=y)=\frac{2y-1}{36}$$

"Intro 
 Thanks for reading.  
 Long question incoming - I tried to make it as complete as possible to best explain where I'm coming from conceptually, as I've talked to a lot of people in my introductory probability class and we all seem to have similar confusions. 
 Allow me to explain: 
 I'm having trouble understanding how to interpret the ""Expected Value"" and the ""Standard Deviation"" of a random variable. 
 I thought I understood them, but after reading this following question from  ""The Art of Probability"" ,  I realized I still don't really understand them. 
 I suggest you scroll down and read the question first. Then if you want, come back up and read the sections titled  ""The way I used to interpret the Expected Value""  and "" The way I used to interpret the Standard Deviation""  for more context. 
 Thank you! 
 
 The way I used to interpret the Expected Value: 
 Say we have some random variable  $X$ , which is associated with the outcome of some random-experiment. Different outcomes of that experiment  (each with their corresponding probabilities)  get mapped to numerical values by  $X$ . 
 The expected value of  $X$  is the average output of  $X$  after a large number of trials of the experiment have been run.  
 That is, if each time we run the experiment we keep track of the output of  $X$   (let's call that output  $x_i$  for the  $i_{th}$  experiment) , sum all those outputs up over a large number  (say  $n$ )  of times, and divide by  $n$ , we'd get  $\mathrm{E}[X]$  as  $n\rightarrow \infty$ . 
 $$\mathrm{E}[X]=\frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n}$$ 
 Alright, cool! 
 Now, as for the Standard Deviation.  
 
 The way I used to interpret the Standard Deviation: 
 In a sense, the Standard Deviation told us how ""expected"" the Expected Value of our random variable really was. 
 The Standard Deviation is the square root of the variance, and the variance is the ""expected"" squared distance of the output of  $X$  from its expected value  $\mathrm{E}[X]$ . 
 So, the Standard Deviation is the expected distance of the outputs of  $X$  from  $\mathrm{E}[X]$ . 
 A small standard deviation means we actually ""expected"" the values of  $X$  to be around  $\mathrm{E}[X]$ , while a large standard deviation meant we ""expected"" the values to be further away. 
 Okay...so far so good. Now on to this question which confuses the heck out of me: 
 
 The Question: 
 In this game, there are two players and a coin. The coin gets tossed repeatedly.  
 One player predicts “Heads” every time, while the other predicts “Tails.” 
 The player that predicts correctly gets a point, while the other loses a point. 
 Let  $X$  be a random variable corresponding to the score of the player that chooses heads every time. 
 In each “trial” (toss),  $X$  is  $+1$  if the toss is heads, and  $-1$  if the toss is tails.  
 We have a fair coin, so that each outcome of  $X$  happens with probability  $\frac{1}{2}$ , making…
 $$E(X)=\frac{1}{2}(+1)+\frac{1}{2}(-1)=0$$ 
…the expected score of that player zero.  
 However, note that this does not mean that we  expect   $X$  to take on a value of 0! This only means that the average score of this player after a lot of games ends up being 0. 
 Or at least...so I thought. Keep on reading! 
 The standard deviation of the game is… 
 $$\sqrt{1*\frac{1}{2}+1*\frac{1}{2}}=1$$ 
…which means we expect the value of  $X$  to deviate by  $1$  from its expected value in each game.  
 That makes sense. After all, if it deviates by  $+1$  for half the games, and  $-1$  for half the games, the score of our player after a bunch of games is  $0$ . However, in no  specific  game do we actually expect our player to get a score of  $0$ , as that's not even an option. Thus, the standard deviation is  $1$  - the score we expect one of our players to get in  each  game. 
 Alright, now we get to the part that's confusing me. 
 Let’s say the players decide to toss the coin  $n$  times. Each  $i_{th}$  game has the random-variable  $X_i$  associated with it, which gives us the points that the player that chooses heads gets on the  $i_{th}$  toss. He gets  $+1$  if its heads, and  $-1$  if its tails. 
 Let’s define a new random variable,  $Y=(X_1+X_2+X_3+⋯X_n)$ .  
 In plain English,  $Y$  is the total payoff for the player choosing heads at the end of the  $n$  games.  
 If  $Y$  is positive, the player choosing heads won, while if it’s negative, the other player won. 
 Let’s first calculate the expected value of  $Y$ . By the linearity of expected values, it’s just the sum of the expected values of each of the  $X_s$ . 
 $$\mathrm{E}[Y]=\mathrm{E}[X_1] + \mathrm{E}[X_2] + ...+ \mathrm{E}[X_n]$$ 
 $$\mathrm{E}[Y]=0$$ 
 Note that this does not mean that after a large number of tosses, the average score (the sum of the score in each toss for all the tosses divided by the total number of tosses) is  $0$ . I mean, it  is   $0$ , but that's not what  $\mathrm{E}[Y]$  is telling us. 
 That, described above, is the expected value of  $X$ !!! That average value of  $X$  after many  $X_s$ ! 
 The expected value of Y is calculating the average value of  $Y$  after many  $Y_s$ !!!  
 In other words, the interpretation of the expected value of  $Y$  is that the two players would play an entire game, with  $n$  tosses,  $m$  times, where  $m$  is a large number.  
 Each play of the game, with  $n$  tosses each, is considered a “trial”. Then, after a large number of “trials”, a large number of games with  $n$  tosses each, the average score would be  $0$ . 
 $$\mathrm{E}[Y]=\frac{y_1 + y_2 + ... + y_m}{m}$$ 
 In this case, it’s obvious to see that if the expected score of each of the  $X_s$  is zero (the average score after a bunch of   $X_s$ ), then the average score of  $Y$  must be zero as well, since each  $Y$  consists of a bunch of  $X_s$  itself. 
 However…now comes the question: How should we INTERPRET the expected value of  $Y$ ?  
 Recall that although the expected value of  $X$  was  $0$ , a score of  $0$  was never really “expected” for any given  $X$ …the standard deviation was  $1$ , meaning that we always expected the final score of any given game to be  $1$  away from  $0$ ,  $1$  away from the expected value. That made sense… 
 Now, what's the standard deviation of  $Y$ ? 
 Well, the variance of  $X$  is  $1$ , and by the linearity of variances, the variance of  $Y$  is the sum of the variances of each of the  $X_s$ . 
 $$\mathrm{Var}[Y] = 1 + 1 + 1 + .... + 1 = n$$ 
 That means that the standard deviation of  $Y$  is  $\sqrt{n}$ , the square root of its variance. 
 But...hold on a second. 
 The expected value of  $X$  was what we expected the average score to be after a large number of tosses. For that, we got  $0$ . 
 $Y$  corresponds to a large number of tosses. To  $n$  tosses. 
 The standard deviation of  $Y$ , which is  $\sqrt{n}$ , is how far away we expect the final score of our player choosing heads to be from the expected value of  $Y$ . We expect it to be  $\sqrt{n}$  away from  $0$ . 
 But...aren't those two statements contradictory? 
 How is it that  $\mathrm{E}[X]=0$ , the average score of our player after a large number of tosses is  $0$ , but the standard deviation of the random variable  $Y$ , which corresponds to a large number  $(n)$  of tosses, is  $\sqrt{n}$ ? 
 How can we both expect the score to be  $0$  after a large number of tosses, and expect the score to be  $\sqrt{n}$  away from  $0$  after a large number of tosses at the same time? 
 
 In conclusion... 
 If the two players were to actually play this game  $n$  times, where  $n$  is really large...what should we ""expect""?! 
 How should the ""Expected Values"" of these random variables, and the ""Standard Deviations"" of these random variables be interpreted?!

"I am having trouble with this question with regards to random variables and calculating expected values: 
 
 Suppose I keep tossing a fair six-sided dice until I roll a $3$. Let $X$ be the number of times I roll the dice. What is the value of $E[X]$? 
 
 So for this problem I was thinking that the answer would just be $1$. Here is my thought behind it.  
 For each turn there is a $1/6$ chance of hitting a three. If I keep rolling and rolling I will eventually hit a $3$. So the math works out to be $(1/6)*6$ which is equal to $1$. Does this logic make sense? I am a bit confused with how exactly I would go about picking the values for $P(X=x)$ and how to calculate expected value. Some insight would be very helpful.

"Problem: 
 A random non-zero positive even integer,  $E$  is picked. 
 We can call the bracketed section in the statement  $E = \{A\cdot2^n\}$  the factored form of this number (because it is even,  $n$  is at least  $1$ ).  $n$  is to be as large as possible ensuring  $A$  is odd. 
 E.g.:  $E= 80$  so  $A=5$  and  $n=4$  because  $5\cdot2^4$  is the factored form of  $80$ . 
 Every time we get a random even number  $E$ , we will divide by  $2$  until we find  $A$ . The question is, on average how much lower is  $A$  than  $E$ , or what is the average  $n$  you should expect to find in the factored form? 
 
 My approach: 
 $1/2$  of all numbers or every other number is even or in other words a factor of  $2^1$ 
 half of the factors of  $2^1$  are factors of  $2^2$ 
 half of the factors of  $2^2$  are factors of  $2^3$ 
 and so on. 
 I believe, adding from  $n=1$  to infinity for  $1/(2^n)\cdot1/(2^n)$  may represent the change from  $E$  to  $A$ . I added a picture with actual sigma notation at the bottom. 
 I got 1/(2^n) because: 
 1/2+1/4+1/8...= 1 
 1/2 of all even numbers have n=1 as the largest n in the factored form
therefore 1/2 of all even numbers can only be divided once by 2 until they become odd 
 1/4 of all even numbers have n=2 as the largest n in the factored form.
therefore 1/4 of all even numbers can be divided once by 4 until they become odd 
 1/8 of all even numbers have n=3 as the largest n in the factored form.
therefore 1/8 of all even numbers can be divided once by 8 until they become odd 
 1/16
etc... 
 generally 1/2^n of all even numbers can be multiplied by 1/2^n until odd 
 therefore addition from 1 to infinity of (1/(2^n))^2 will represent the difference from E to A out of a whole 
 According to my sigma calculator, squaring each term before adding them suggesting  $A=\frac{1}{3}E$ . I'm convinced I messed up somewhere in trying to calculate the average difference between  $E$  and  $A$ .

Knowing that between each man there  have to be at least one woman  and they are sitting at the round table, then we are left with $\left(n-m\right)$ women to arrange. There are exactly $m$ places (gaps, so $m-1$ walls dividing these places) to put women, there are $P_0\left(n-m, m-1\right)=\frac{(n-m+m-1)!}{\left(n-m\right)!\left(m-1\right)!}=\frac{\left(n-1\right)!}{\left(n-m\right)!\left(m-1\right)!}$ ways to arrange women in these places (arrangement with repetitions of elements with 2 types). Then as on each chair sits only either man or woman, I multiplied the answer by $2$ (it is like shifting all combinations by 1 chair).

 In case of discrete distributions with finite number of possible outcome the entropy is

 Now, to show that this doesn't uniformly converge on the whole interval I am really only interested in the boundary points (since any compact subset supposedly makes it uniformly convergent). As $x \to 0$ our function goes to $1$and as $x \to \infty$ our function goes to $0$. I am unsure of how to calculate 
 $$\left|\left|\frac{n^2\sin(x)}{1+n^2x}-\frac{\sin(x)}{x} \right|\right|_S$$  
 and, moreover, show that it is $0$. From there, on any compact subset of $S$ I am guessing that  
 $$\left|\left|\frac{n^2\sin(x)}{1+n^2x}-\frac{\sin(x)}{x} \right|\right|=0$$  
 Will be zero since if we consider $[a,b] \subset S$ we have 
 $$\left|\left|\frac{n^2\sin(x)}{1+n^2x}-\frac{\sin(x)}{x} \right|\right| \leq \left|\frac{n^2\sin(a)}{1+n^2a}\right|+\left|\frac{\sin(a)}{a}\right|=0$$

"My question is: what is the correct value to use for "" $n$ "" in formulas pertaining to the mean and variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. 
 Let's say we are taking  $25$  samples from a population  $64$  times.
And we want to calculate  $\mu_{\bar{X}}$ 
 I would think we would estimate for each sample of  $25$  elements  $\bar{X}_k=\frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{25}X_i}{25}$ .
And then  $\mu_{\bar{X}}=\frac{\Sigma_{k=1}^{64}\bar{X}_k}{64}$ 
 Similarly, for the variance,  $\sigma_{\bar{X}}= \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma_{k=1}^{64}(\bar{X}_k- \mu_{\bar{X}})^2}{64}}$ 
 What makes me skeptical that this is correct is that all the formulas for these parameter estimates have an "" $n$ "" which seems to refer to the sample size. And In the context of what I'm asking, is that  $25$  or  $64$ . 
 In particular in the relation:  $\sigma_{\bar{X}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$  is  $n=25$  or  $64$ , or maybe even  $25\times 64= 1600$ .

"I need to caluclate the time needed for a given point  A  (x,y) to move out of the given circle  B  (x,y,r). The speed of the point  A  is given by the change of  x  and  y  per second. 
 At the beginning I calculated if the point  A  is even in circle  B , which was not hard given the formular:  $$(x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2 < r^2$$ 
 Then I thought of a way to calculate not only if the point is outside the circle, but when it's outside the circle by adding the coordinate of the movement into the equation. Let's say the speed of the point  A  is  $\Delta x$  and  $\Delta y$  and time is  $t$ . I then tried to add this to the equation to  $x_A$  and  $y_A$ :  $$(x_A + \Delta x * t - x_B)^2 + (y_A + \Delta y * t - y_B)^2 < r^2$$ 
 Since then I am trying to figure out how to extract the time  $t$  to calculate it, but I have been stuck. Is this even the right/best way to calculate it? 
 I am using it in programming, so there are certainly some dirty hacks I could use (calculation in for-loops) - but those would be ugly and I want to understand the mathematics behind it.

"Let's say you have a ""parallelogram"" of points $P = \{(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)\}$. This parallelogram lies between $u = (2, 1)$ and $v = (-1, 2)$. 
 Then for any point $n \in \mathbb{Z}^2$, you can write 
 $n = dQ + r$, 
 where $Q = \begin{pmatrix} u\\ v\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}2 &1 \\ -1 &2\end{pmatrix}$, and $r \in P$.

 Background 
 The reason I'm interested in this is that I use it in a large variety of algorithms, including sub-sampling of grids, maze generation, and using grids to represent more complicated things (for example, using a hex grid to represent a triangular grid + vertices). 
 Although I have ways to calculate $d$ and $r$ given $n$ and $Q$, my algorithms are rather clumsy, and ""hacked together"". I'd like to back this with some theory, perhaps simplify and optimize the algorithms, and be in a better position to design related algorithms and be able to justify it mathematically.

 Solving gives $\phi=\arcsin \frac R{R-1}$ and things get a little messy.

 An office parking lot provides 12 parking spots.  
 There are 14 employees.  
 On average, 10 employees arrive by car.  
 What is the probability that parking space is sufficient on a given working day? 
 
 My attempt so far:   
 As I understand, ""on average"" is equivalent to the expected value. Let  $X$  denote the number of employees arriving on a day. Then,  
 $$E (X) = \sum_{i=0}^{14} p_i x_i = 10$$ 
 So the distribution isn't uniform, since then the expected value would be 7. Also, this implies  $P(X \leq 10) = P(X \geq 10)$ , although I don't see how that's useful.  
 What I need to calculate is  $$P(X \leq 12) = \sum_{i=0}^{12} p_i x_i = 1- \sum_{i=13}^{14} p_i x_i$$ 
 Now, without knowing the distribution, I'd say there is no way to obtain the correct solution.  
 
 For instance, it could be that  $p_{10} = 1$  and then  $P(X \leq 12) = 1$ .  
 It could also be that  $p_{6} = p_{7} = p_{13} = p_{14} = 0.25$  and then  $P(X \leq 12) = 0.5$ 
 
 I also don't see any point in assuming a normal distribution in this case.  
 
 If it were centered on the median value, the expectation would be 7 cars instead of 10 per day.  
 If it were centered on 10, the expectation would be less then 10, because  $p_i = 0$  for  $i > 14$ .  
 It could work if it were centered somewhere between 10 and 14, but what sense does that make?

 And since the results still need to sum up to  $100$ , I calculate one of them, and then calculate the other via "" $1000$  minus the previous"". 
 I'd like to know which one to choose such that the outcome will be as accurate as possible. 
 One problem that arises is how to even define  accurate  here (i.e., how to measure the accuracy of the outcome). 
 So let's define the accuracy as  $p(x,y)=|\frac{x}{y}-\frac{x'}{y'}|$ , where  $x'$  and  $y'$  are the two outcomes. 
 The smaller  $p(x,y)$  is, the more accurate is the result of my computation.

"I was trying to calculate the maximum ground distance you can see on mountains, with your elvation given. 
 After some simple geometry, I was able to come up with the following formula: 
 Let $h$
  be your elevation, $d(h)$
  be the maximal distance you can see, then  
 $$d(h)=2\pi R\arccos\frac{R}{R+h}$$ 
 where R is the radius of earth. We take $R=6378100m$ 
  as its value. 
 But when I plot it in excel, here's what I got: 
The unit for the vertical axis is km while the unit for the horizontal axis is m. 
 Amazingly, for $d\in(0,20000m)$ (essentially the maximum elevation you can achieve without paying millions to board a spaceship)
 , $d(h)$
  can be approximated by  
 $$d(h)\approx22345\sqrt{h}$$ 
 here  
 with a $r^{2}$
 value of 1!. 
 Only when $h>5\cdot10^{5}m$
  dose the the approximation begin to deviate away significantly. 
 Does any one have a explanation of this from a numerical prespective?

"Suppose there are three boxes, each has  $9$  white balls and  $1$  colored ball: 
 Box  $1$ :  $9$  white and  $1$  red. 
 Box  $2$ :  $9$  white and  $1$  green. 
 Box  $3$ :  $9$  white and  $1$  blue. 
 Now I am drawing balls from the boxes with replacement. In each trial, I draw  $1$  ball from each of the three boxes. If any of them is red, I increase my red ball counter by  $1$ , then I put all balls back to their respective boxes. Similarly, I increase the corresponding counter if I get a green ball or a blue ball. The trials end only if my counters for all red, green and blue balls are at least  $1$  (i.e., I get balls of each color at least once over all the trials). 
 The question is, how do I calculate the expected number of trials until I hit the end condition? 
 I know, if I only have  $1$  box, then it is a simple geometric distribution, with  $p=\frac{1}{10}$ , and hence the expected number of trials will be  $10$ . But now, although the three events (get a red ball, get a green ball and get a blue ball) are independent, the combined event is not. And also since it is possible to have more than one event happen in each trial (e.g., getting red from box  $1$  and green from box  $2$  in the same trial), I cannot consider the events to happen one after another.

 Verify if the following polynomial over the indicated field is irreducible. 
 $p=x^4+2x^2-x+1 \in \mathbb{Z_7}[x]$ 
 
 Because $p$ is degree $4$, it can only be factorized as the following cases: 
 i)  $p=h \cdot g$, where either $h$ or $g$ is degree $1$ and the other is $3$ 
 ii)  $p=h \cdot g$, where  $h$ and $g$ are degree $2$  
 For  i)  I can simply calculate the zeros of $p$ and check if there is any $h$ or $g$ with degree $1$. 
 We are in $\mathbb{Z_7}[x],$ so $x \in \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.

 $p(1)=3$ 
 $p(2)=2$ 
 $p(3)=6$ 
 $p(4)=5$

"In linear algebra and differential geometry, there are various structures which we calculate with in a basis or local coordinates, but which we would like to have a meaning which is basis independent or coordinate independent, or at least, changes in some covariant way under changes of basis or coordinates. One way to ensure that our structures adhere to this principle is to give their definitions without reference to a basis. Often we employ universal properties, functors, and natural transformations to encode these natural, coordinate/basis free structures. But the Riemannian volume form does not appear to admit such a description, nor does its pointwise analogue in linear algebra. 
 Let me list several examples. 
 
 In linear algebra, an inner product on $V$ is an element of $\operatorname{Sym}^2{V^*}$. The symmetric power is a space which may be defined by a universal property, and constructed via a quotient of a tensor product. No choice of basis necessary. Alternatively an inner product can be given by an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix. The correspondence between the two alternatives is given by $g_{ij}=g(e_i,e_j)$. Calculations are easy with this formulation, but one should check (or require) that the matrix transforms appropriately under changes of basis. 
 In linear algebra, a volume form is an element of $\Lambda^n(V^*)$. Alternatively one may define a volume form operator as the determinant of the matrix of the components of $n$ vectors, relative to some basis. 
 In linear algebra, an orientation is an element of $\Lambda^n(V^*)/\mathbb{R}^>$. 
 In linear algebra, a symplectic form is an element of $\Lambda^2(V^*)$. Alternatively may be given as some $\omega_{ij}\,dx^i\wedge dx^j$. 
 In linear algebra, given a symplectic form, a canonical volume form may be chosen as $\operatorname{vol}=\omega^n$. This operation can be described as a natural transformation $\Lambda^2\to\Lambda^n$. That is, to each vector space $V$, we have a map $\Lambda^2(V)\to\Lambda^n(V)$ taking $\omega\mapsto \omega^n$ and this map commutes with linear maps between spaces. 
 In differential geometry, all the above linear algebra concepts may be specified pointwise. Any smooth functor of vector spaces may be applied to the tangent bundle to give a smooth vector bundle. Thus a Riemannian metric is a section of the bundle $\operatorname{Sym}^2{T^*M}$, etc. A symplectic form is a section of the bundle $\Lambda^2(M)$, and the wedge product extends to an operation on sections, and gives a symplectic manifold a volume form. This is a global operation; this definition of a Riemannian metric gives a smoothly varying inner product on every tangent space of the manifold,  even if the manifold is not covered by a single coordinate patch 
 In differential geometry, sometimes vectors are defined as $n$-tuples which transform as $v^i\to \tilde{v}^j\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial \tilde{x}^j}$ under a change of coordinates $x \to \tilde{x}$. But a more invariant definition is to say a vector is a derivation of the algebra of smooth functions. Cotangent vectors can be defined with a slightly different transformation rule, or else invariantly as the dual space to the tangent vectors. Similar remarks hold for higher rank tensors. 
 In differential geometry, one defines a connection on a bundle. The local coordinates definition makes it appear to be a tensor, but it does not behave the transformation rules set forth above. It's only clear why when one sees the invariant definition. 
 In differential geometry, there is a derivation on the exterior algebra called the exterior derivative. It may be defined as $d\sigma = \partial_j\sigma_I\,dx^j\wedge dx^I$ in local coordinates, or better via an invariant formula $d\sigma(v_1,\dotsc,v_n) = \sum_i(-1)^iv_i(\sigma(v_1,\dotsc,\hat{v_i},\dotsc,v_n)) + \sum_{i+j}(-1)^{i+j}\sigma([v_i,v_j],v_1,\dotsc,\hat{v_i},\dotsc,\hat{v_j},\dotsc,v_n)$ 
 Finally, the volume form on an oriented inner product space (or volume density on an inner product space) in linear algebra, and its counterpart the Riemannian volume form on an oriented Riemannian manifold (or volume density form on a Riemannian manifold) in differential geometry. Unlike the above examples which all admit global basis-free/coordinate-free definitions, we can define it only in a single coordinate patch or basis at a time, and glue together to obtain a globally defined structure. There are two definitions seen in the literature: 
 
 choose an (oriented) coordinate neighborhood of a point, so we have a basis for each tangent space. Write the metric tensor in terms of that basis. Pretend that the bilinear form is actually a linear transformation (this can always be done because once a basis is chosen, we have an isomorphism to $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is isomorphic to its dual (via a different isomorphism than that provided by the inner product)). Then take the determinant of resulting mutated matrix, take the square root, multiply by the wedge of the basis one-forms (the positive root may be chosen in the oriented case; in the unoriented case, take the absolute value to obtain a density). 
 Choose an oriented orthonormal coframe in a neighborhood. Wedge it together. (Finally take the absolute value in the unoriented case). 
 
 
 Does anyone else think that one of these definitions sticks out like a sore thumb? Does it bother anyone else that in linear algebra, the volume form on an oriented inner product space doesn't exist as natural transformation $\operatorname{Sym}^2 \to \Lambda^n$? Do the instructions to ""take the determinant of a bilinear form"" scream out to anyone else that we're doing it wrong? Does it bother anyone else that in Riemannian geometry, in stark contrast to the superficially similar symplectic case, the volume form cannot be defined using invariant terminology for the whole manifold, but rather requires one to break the manifold into patches, and choose a basis for each? Is there any other structure in linear algebra or differential geometry which suffers from this defect? 
 Answer:  I've accepted Willie Wong's answer below, but let me also sum it up, since it's spread across several different places. There is a canonical construction of the Riemannian volume form on an oriented vector space, or pseudoform on a vector space. At the level of level of vector spaces, we may define an inner product on the dual space $V^*$ by $\tilde{g}(\sigma,\tau)=g(u,v)$ where $u,v$ are the dual vectors to $\sigma,\tau$ under the isomorphism between $V,V^*$ induced by $g$ (which is nondegenerate). Then extend $\tilde{g}$ to $\bigotimes^k V^*$ by defining $\hat{g}(a\otimes b\otimes c,\dotsb,x\otimes y\otimes z\dotsb)=\tilde{g}(a,x)\tilde{g}(b,y)\tilde{g}(c,z)\dotsb$. Then the space of alternating forms may be viewed as a subspace of $\bigotimes^k V^*$, and so inherits an inner product as well (note, however that while the alternating map may be defined canonically, there are varying normalization conventions which do not affect the kernel. I.e. $v\wedge w = k! Alt(v\otimes w)$ or $v\wedge w = Alt(v\otimes w)$). Then $\hat{g}(a\wedge b\dotsb,x\wedge y\dotsb)=\det[\tilde{g}(a,x)\dotsc]$ (with perhaps a normalization factor required here, depending on how Alt was defined). 
 Thus $g$ extends to an inner product on $\Lambda^n(V^*)$, which is a 1 dimensional space, so there are only two unit vectors, and if $V$ is oriented, there is a canonical choice of volume form. And in any event, there is a canonical pseudoform.

"I'm doing one of the exercises of Stewart and Tall's book on Algebraic Number Theory. The problem concerns finding an expression for the norm in the cyclotomic field $K = \mathbb{Q}(e^{2\pi i / 5})$. The exact problem is the following: 
 
 
 If $\zeta = e^{2 \pi i / 5}$, $K = \mathbb{Q}(e^{2\pi i / 5})$, prove that the norm of $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ is of the form $\frac{1}{4}(A^2 -5B^2)$ where $A, B \in \mathbb{Z}$.  
 ( Hint:  In calculating $\textbf{N}(\alpha)$, first calculate $\sigma_1 (\alpha) \sigma_4 (\alpha)$ where $\sigma_i (\zeta) := \zeta^{i}$. Show that this is of the form $q + r\theta + s\phi$ where $q, r, s \in \mathbb{Z}$, $\theta = \zeta + \zeta^{4}$ and $\phi = \zeta^{2} + \zeta^{3}$. In the same way establish $\sigma_2 (\alpha) \sigma_3 (\alpha) = q + s\theta + r\phi$  ) 
 Using Exercise $3$ prove that $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ has an infinite number of units. 
 
 
 Now, I've already done what the hint says and arrived at the following. If we let $\alpha = a +b\zeta^{} + c\zeta^{2} + d\zeta^{3} \in \mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ then after simplifying I get 
 $$\textbf{N}(\alpha) = \sigma_1 (\alpha) \sigma_4 (\alpha) \sigma_2(\alpha) \sigma_3(\alpha) = ( q + r\theta + s\phi ) ( q + s\theta + r\phi )$$ 
 $$ = q^2 + (qr + qs)(\theta + \phi) + rs(\theta^2 + \phi^2) + (r^2 + s^2)\theta \phi$$ 
 and then it is not that hard to see that $\theta + \phi = -1$, $\theta^2 + \phi^2 = 3$ and $\theta \phi = -1$ so that in the end one obtains 
 $$\textbf{N}(\alpha) = q^2 - (qr + qs) + 3rs - (r^2 + s^2)$$ 
 where $q = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$, $r = ab + bc + cd$ and $s = ac + ad + bd$. 
 Now, here I got stuck because I just can't take the last expression for the norm into the form that the exercise wants.  
 The purpose is to get that nice form for the norm to find units by solving the diophantine equation $\textbf{N}(\alpha) = \pm 1$, which is what the Exercise $3$ mentioned in the statatement of the problem is about. 
 I already know how to prove the existence of infinitely many units in $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ (without using Dirichlet's Unit Theorem of course), but the exercise also demands a proof that the norm is equal to $\frac{1}{4}(A^2 -5B^2)$.  
 I even asked my professor about this and we were not able to get the desired form for the norm.  
 
 
 So my question is if anybody knows how to prove that the norm has that form, and if so, how can I show that? Or if it could be that maybe the hint given in the exercise is not that helpful? 
 
 
 Thanks a lot in advance for any help with this. 
 EDIT 
 After looking at Derek Jennings' answer below, to get from the expression I had for the norm to the one in Derek's answer is just a matter of taking out a common factor of $1/4$ in the expression and then completing the square, 
 $$\textbf{N}(\alpha) = q^2 - (qr + qs) + 3rs - (r^2 + s^2) = q^2 - q(r+s) + rs - (r-s)^2$$ 
 $$ = \frac{1}{4}( 4q^2 - 4q(r+s) + 4rs - 4(r-s)^2  ) $$ $$=  \frac{1}{4} ( 4q^2 - 4q(r+s) +\overbrace{(r+s)^2} - \overbrace{(r+s)^2} + 4rs - 4(r-s)^2  )$$ 
 $$ = \frac{1}{4} ( (2q -(r+s))^2 -(r-s)^2 - 4(r-s)^2 )$$ 
 $$ = \frac{1}{4}( (2q - r - s)^2 - 5(r-s)^2 ) = \frac{1}{4}(A^2 - 5B^2),$$ 
 as desired. Of course it is easier if you already know what to get at =)

"I'm trying to understand Likelihood Ratio Tests, Likelihood Functions and Hypotheses Tests, which makes up a significant amount of what we're supposed to learn in my statistics for beginners course. But I'm very new to this level of maths, so a lot of the rigorous knowledge and intuitive understanding is unfortunately missing for me; my apologies then for the length of the post from my over explaining some things.  
 I was wondering if you could tell me from my summation if my understanding of these processes is correct/where I've gone wrong?  
 My understanding so far: 
 Imagine you have collected a sample of data from some population; say you know the type of distribution that models the population, but you are unsure of the value of one of the parameters. So you construct a Likelihood Function, and work out the value of your parameter $\theta$ that maximises the probability of your sample data under that distribution. And you do this by taking the (Log) Likelihood Function, differentiating and setting equal to zero, then solving for $\theta$. I.e. if you were to graph 'Probability of your sample occurring' on the Y-axis vs the potential values of your parameter $\theta$ on X-axis, you would be finding the $\theta$ that maximises this function on your graph. 
 So now comes Likelihood Ratio Tests. As I understand it so far, the purpose of an LRT is to workout whether the parameter you've identified as maximising is better than some null-hypothesis parameter, by a  statistically significant  level. Otherwise without doing an LRT, it might be that your proposed maximising $\theta$ was only marginally better, and maybe only for this sample, than the null value due to something like sampling error, yet you thought it was definitively better. Now if I understand Null Hypotheses Tests right, in the case where your null hyp is rejected, the test doesn't then specifically tell you which other hyp is the actual true one, a hypothesis test just tells you whether or not the null-hyp is true or not (if it's not true though, you know the true hypothesis will be a member of the null's complement). 
 Then, let: 
 $H_0 = {}$'$\theta_\text{Null-Hyp}$ is the value of the parameter that maximises your Likelihood Function.' 
 $H_1 = {}$'$\theta_\text{Null-Hyp}$ is not the maximising value (and thus the max value $\theta \in \Theta_\text{Alt-Hyp}$, where $\Theta_\text{Alt-Hyp} = \theta_\text{Null-Hyp}^c)$.' 
 $L(\theta) = {}$Likelihood Function with $\theta$ as your maximising parameter. 
 The Likelihood Ratio is then: 
 $$\frac{L(\theta_\text{Null-Hyp})}{L(\Theta_\text{Alt-Hyp})} \leqslant K$$ 
 So, constructing your LRT: when setting up your LRT you first pick the confidence lvl (say 95%) you want. Then you work out the K that corresponds to this confidence lvl (more on this later). Now for every $\theta$ $\in$ $\Theta_\text{Alt-Hyp}$, s.t. the ratio is $\leqslant K$, you can say with 95% confidence that these $\theta$ output, by a  statistically significant  amount, a higher value for the Likelihood Function than $\theta_\text{Null-Hyp}$. So you reject the null hypothesis. And of course, you already knew the $\theta \in \Theta_\text{Alt-Hyp}$ that maximises the Likelihood Function, but now you're very confident this value wasn't produced from your sample erroneously, e.g. from things like sampling error, etc. 
 That's my summation of the process, which I thought was approximately right - though please let me know where I've gone wrong. 
 However, it's in the the process of the below example that I am most confused. 
 
 In this example about honey pots, 
 https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/309 
 the author is trying to find the mean weight of the population from a sample of pots. They construct an LRT with an (as far as I understand it) arbitrarily chosen value for the $H_0$ pop mean of $\theta_\text{Null-Hyp} = 10,$ and Sig Lvl of $\alpha = 0.05.$ Their variable for $\theta_\text{Alt-Hyp}$ is $\bar X$. 
 The author takes the Likelihood Ratio, manipulates the algebra, and arrives at the equation: 
 $$Z= \frac{\bar X-10}{\sigma / \sqrt n} = f(K) $$ 
 From this they look up the Z statistic for $\alpha = 0.05$ to say that $f(K) = 1.96.$ They then find the inverse of $f(K)$ to find their value of $K.$ 
 Here's why I'm confused. If in the end they use the Z-Statistic to calculate their value of K, why don't they just skip straight to calculating the Z-stat in the first place, instead of doing the LRT? If they work to make sure they can input $\bar X$ into the Z-stat to be able to decide whether to reject $H_0$, why do they then continue with the LRT, or use it in the first place? On top of this, what determines what value you should choose for the null hypothesis? 
 Clearly I'm missing something in my understanding (as well as any holes in my explanations above), so if anyone could fill in my knowledge gaps I'd really appreciate it. 
 I apologise that this is such a long post, thanks for your time so far. Any help you could offer would be greatly appreciated.

"So I have this probability exercise and I'd like to know if it is correct, along with my reasoning, so here is the exercise: 
 
 In a computer installation, 200 programs are written each week, 120 in
  C++ and 80 in Java. 60% of the programs written in C++ compile on the
  first run 80% of the Java programs compile on the first run.  
 What is the probability that a program chosen at random: 
 1.  is written in C++ or compiles on first run? 
 2.  is written in Java or does not compile? 
 3.  either compiles or does not compile? 
 
 So here is my solution to each question along with my reasoning: 
 
 1)  P(C++ $\cup$ Success) = P(C++) + P(Success) - P(C++ $\cap$ Success)  
 This is due to the fact that both of these events have elements in common which are 1st runs which are either Success or Fail. And since they are not mutually exclusive the formula is: 
 P(A $\cup$ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A $\cap$ B) 
 The solution then is: 
 C++ programs are $\frac{120}{200}$ = 0.6 
 Total successful runs are: ((120 $\times \frac{60}{100}$)+(80 $\times$ $\frac{80}{100}$)) $\div$ 200 = $\frac{136}{200}$ = 0.68 
 P(C++ $\cap$ Success) = (120 $\times$ $\frac{60}{100}$) $\div$ 200 = $\frac{72}{200}$ = 0.36 
 Hence: 
 P(C++ $\cup$ Success) = 0.6 + 0.68 - 0.36 = 0.92 = 92% 
 
 Next off: 
 
 2)  P(Java $\cup$ Fail) = P(Java) + P(Fail) - P(Java $\cap$ Fail) 
 Same as before, these events are not mutual exclusive, hence the formula. 
 In this example since we have to calculate the probability of a Fail on 1st run, we use the  Complement Event Theorem  which states that P(E') = 1 - P(E), which in our example it is P(Fail) = 1 - P(Success), hence we can easily calculate that using previously calculated Success: 
 P(Fail) = 1 - P(Success) = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32 
 Java programs are $\frac{80}{200}$ = 0.4 
 P(Java $\cap$ Fail) = ((80 - (80 $\times$ $\frac{80}{100}$)) $\div$ 200) = 0.08  
 Hence: 
 P(Java $\cup$ Fail) = 0.4 + 0.32 0.08 = 0.64 = 64% 
 
 And last: 
 
 3)  P(Success $\cup$ Fail) = P(Success) + P(Fail) = P(Success) + (1 - P(Success)) 
 Intuitively this will be equal to 1, but for the sake of argument let's write it down, cause on exams you need to prove it. 
 From previous calculations we know that P(Success) = 0.68, and P(Fail) = 0.32, 
 Hence: 
 P(Success $\cup$ Fail) = 0.68 + 0.32 = 1 = 100% 
 
 Is everything correct? If not then why?

 So I have $$\mathcal{B}=\left\{\vec{v}_{1}=\left[\begin{array}{r}-1\\2\end{array}\right],\vec{v}_{2}=\left[\begin{array}{r}2\\-3\end{array}\right]\right\}$$ which forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and I want to find the coordinate vector of $\left[\begin{array}{r}x\\y\end{array}\right]$ with respect to $\mathcal{B}$. Wouldn't I calculate $$\left[\begin{array}{rr}-1&2\\2&-3\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{r}x\\y\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{r}-x+2y\\2x-3y\end{array}\right]?$$  
 Unless I am completely misunderstanding the material in this chapter, wouldn't $(3x+2y)\vec{v}_{1}+(2x+y)\vec{v}_{2}$ imply that the coordinate vector is $\left[\begin{array}{r}3x+2y\\2x+y\end{array}\right]$? 
 What could I be misunderstanding? Why are the answers different?

"Say we have a multiset $S(\mathbf{d}$) where $\mathbf{d}$ is a list of $l$ numbers and the multiplicity of the $i$th element of $S$ is $d_i$. The cardinality $N$ of $S$ is $\sum d_i$. 
 We want to partition $S$ into $m$ multisets of size $k_i$ respectively, so that $\sum k_i = \sum d_i = N$. How many ways can we do this? 
 In my mind this is a generalization of the multinomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m}$ representing the number of ways to partition a set of $n=\sum k_i$ objects into $m$ bins of sizes $k_i$, to a sort of number like $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m}$ or $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{\mathbf{k}}$ representing the number of ways to partition a multiset of $n=\sum k_i = \sum d_i$ into $m$ bins of sizes $k_i$. 
 There are a few special cases that are simpler to calculate: 
 
 If $m=1$, then clearly $k_1 = N$ and you're choosing the whole multiset. So $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{(N)} = 1$ 
 If $m=2$, then you only have to handle choosing $k_1$ or $k_2$ elements from a multiset, because the rest will be the other set. So, as mentioned below, you can use a generating function and $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{(k_1,k_2)}$ is equal to the coefficient of $x^{k_1}$ or $x^{k_2}$ in $\prod\limits_{i=1}^l 1 + x^2 + \cdots + x^{d_i} = \prod\limits_{i=1}^l \frac{1-x^{d_i - 1}}{1 - x}$. But then you also need to account for the fact that order doesn't matter, which I'm not sure how to do. Like in the first example below, you would find that there are $3$ ways to choose $2$ elements, but there are only $2$ ways to split the multiset because you have to choose 2 of them that are compatible. 
 
 Examples 
 Let's say that $\mathbf{d} = (2, 2)$, so $S(\mathbf{d})$ might be $\{a, a, b, b\}$. Let $k_1 = k_2 = 2$, so we need to find all the ways of splitting $S$ into two sub-multisets of size $2$. There are exactly $2$ ways of doing this: $\{\{a,a\},\{b,b\}\}$ and $\{\{a,b\},\{a,b\}\}$, so $\binom{(2,2)}{(2,2)} = 2$. 
 Another example: $\mathbf{d} = (2,2)$, so $S(\mathbf{d})$ could be $\{a,a,b,b\}$. Let $k_1 = 1$, $k_2 = 1$, and $k_3 = 2$. There are $3$ ways of doing this: $\{\{a\},\{a\},\{b,b\}\}$, $\{\{b\},\{b\},\{a,a\}\}$, and $\{\{a\},\{b\},\{a,b\}\}$. So $\binom{(2,2)}{(1,1,2)}=3$. 
 My Attempts 
 I've tried to figure this out two ways. The first was to find a recurrence relation and some base cases, kind of how Stirling numbers of the second kind can be computed using the identity $S(n,k) = kS(n-1,k) + S(n-1,k-1)$. I tried to think about what happens if you already have a partition and want to add an element to the original multiset, but then you have to decide which bin that element will go into or whether or not to add a new bin. 
 I also tried to derive it in the way that multinomial coefficients are derived, by counting the number of ways to fill the first bin, and then the second, and so on. The number of ways to choose $k_1$ elements from the multiset to put in the first bin can be computed by finding the coefficient of $x^{k_1}$ in $\prod\limits_{i=1}^l 1+x+x^2+\cdots+x^{d_i}$, which isn't explicit but it's a start. But then, depending on which elements you chose, you don't know how to adjust your multiset to reflect the remaining elements.

 Then I use the definition of $E(X|Y=y),$ so doing the computations I get $$E(X|Y=y)=\dfrac{6y+14}{6+3y}.$$  
 Due to the above, we conclude that $E(X|Y)=\dfrac{6Y+14}{6+3Y}.$ Then we want to calculate $$P(\dfrac{6Y+14}{6+3Y}=y)$$ which is equivalent to compute $f_{Y}(\frac{6y-14}{6-3y}),$ but here is my problem.

 A highway contains a uniform distribution of cars moving at maximum flux in the $x$-direction, which is unbounded

  understand whether they should limit the rate per unit length of cars, $α$, entering the highway via this on-ramp,
  to avoid traffic jams on the highway. The on-ramp is closed for all time $t < 0$, and opens for $t ≥ 0$. 
 Calculate the characteristics, any related shocks/fans, car density and hence plot the space-time diagram.
  Using this diagram, give a mathematical expression for the density, $ρ(x, t)$. Hint: A complicated first-order

"Working on some math for school I came across the following exercise: 
 John is examining how large a proportion of the population want to buy a 
newly released phone model. The answers are given as the confidence interval
(0.3, 0.42) which has the confidence level 0.95. How many persons (n) were
asked?
 
 According to the book, for a confidence level of 0.95 I should use the following formula to calculate the sample size: 
 $\bar{z}+1.96{\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}-(\bar{z}-1.96{\sigma \over \sqrt{n}})$ 
 $\bar{z}+1.96{\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}-\bar{z}+1.96{\sigma \over \sqrt{n}} = 3.92{\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}$ 
 This makes sense. As I am not given the standard deviation, I calculate it as suggested in  this answer  on roughly the same topic. I get 
 $\sigma = \sqrt{0.3(1-0.3)}\approx 0.46$ 
 So I enter this into the expression and get 
 ${{3.92*0.46} \over \sqrt{n}} = {1.56 \over \sqrt{n}}$ 
 Now this is where it all falls apart for me. According to the book I should now set the above expression to be equal to the maximum length of the interval, and then calculate  n  from there, which makes sense. But I was never given an interval length. So how do I procede? 
 (Looking at the answer tells me that $n=246$, which gives the length $l\approx 0.01$, but as I can't use this in my calculations it doesn't really help me.)

"One of my Calculus lecture slides has the following exercise on it: 
 
 Let  $g(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{x}}$ . Calculate  $g'(4)$  directly from the definition of derivative as a limit. 
 
 Since we already learned the basic differentiation rules, I can tell that  $\require{cancel} \cancel{g'(4) = 0}$   $g'(4)= - \frac{1}{8}$ . But I don't know how to calculate this result from the definition of derivative as a limit. 
 We learned of two equivalent definitions of derivatives as a limit: 
 $$ f'(a) = \lim\limits_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \tag{1}\label{1}$$ 
 and 
 $$ f'(a) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0}\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}, \text{ where } h = x - a \tag{2}\label{2}$$ 
 Using \eqref{1}: 
 $$g'(4) = \lim\limits_{x \to 4} \frac{g(x) - g(4)}{x - 4} = \lim\limits_{x \to 4} \frac{\frac{2}{\sqrt{x}} - 1}{x - 4} = \lim\limits_{x \to 4} \frac{2x^{-1} - 1}{x - 4}$$ 
 How do I proceed from here? 
 Alternately, using \eqref{2}: 
 $$ g'(4) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{g(4 + h) - 1}{h} = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{2(4 + h)^{-1/2} - 1}{h}$$

There's a part where you have to calculate neighborhoods of one image (matrix of, for example $256 \times 256$) and those neighborhoods have to be $2^k$ size square. 
 
 Step 1: Take averages at every point over neighborhoods whose sizes are powers of two, e.g., $1\times1$, $2\times2$, $\cdots$, $32\times32$. The average over the neighborhood of size $2^k\times2^k$ at the point $(x,y)$ is $$A_k(x,y)=\sum_{i=x-2^{k-1}}^{x+2^{k-1}-1}\sum_{j=y-2^{k-1}}^{y+2^{k-1}-1}f(i,j)\big/2^{2k}$$ where $f(i,j)$ is the gray-level at $(x,y)$. 
 
 Ok that's great. 
 Then I have to calculate a difference: 
 
 Step 2: For each point, at each point, take differences between pairs of averages corresponding to pairs of non-overlapping neighborhoods just on opposite sides of the point in both horizontal and vertical orientations. For examples, the difference in the horizontal case is $$E_{k,h}(x,y)=\left|A_k\left(x+2^{k-1},y\right)-A_k\left(x-2^{k-1},y\right)\right|.$$ 
 
 Let $A(0,0)$ be the point where I want to calculate the difference. 
 If I use $A(0,0)$, I will go out of bounds on the second member.

"I am seeking verification of my solution to the below problem, or tips on how my solution can be improved. Here is the problem:  
 For which complex numbers  $a,b,c,d$  is the matrix  \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & a & b \\
0 & 1 & c & d \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 2 
\end{bmatrix} 
diagonalizable over  $\mathbb{C}$  ?  
 Here is my approach to the problem:  
 Denote the above matrix by  $A$ . Then  $A$   is diagonalizable if and only if for every eigenvalue  $\lambda$  of  $A$ , the algebraic multiplicity of  $\lambda$  is equal to the geometric multiplicity of  $\lambda$ .  
 One can quickly calculate the characteristic polynomial of  $A$ , and find that it is given by  $p_A(x) = (1-x)^2(2-x)^2$ . Thus, we have two eigenvalues  $\lambda = 1$  and  $\lambda = 2$ , both with algebraic multiplicity  $2$ . Thus,  $A$  is diagonalizable if and only if the geometric multiplicity of  $\lambda = 1$  is  $2$  and the geometric multiplicity of  $\lambda = 2$  is  $2$ .  
 $A-1I = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 0 & a & b \\
0 & 0 & c & d \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}$ . We need the dimension of the null space of  $A - 1I$  to be equal to  $2$  in order for  $A$  to be diagonalizable. Using the rank-nullity theorem, this is equivalent to asking that the rank of  $A - 1I$  is equal to  $2$ , i.e., that there are two nonzero rows in the row echelon form of  $A-1I$ . I claim this occurs if:  
 $1)$   $a,b,c,d$  are all equal to  $0$ ,    
 $2)$   $a,d \neq 0$  and  $b,c = 0$   
 $3$   $a,d = 0$  and  $b,c \neq 0$ 
 $A-2I = \begin{bmatrix} 
-1 & 0 & a & b \\
0 & -1 & c & d \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}$ . Similar to the above, we need two nonzero rows in the row echelon form of  $A-2I$  in order for  $A$  to be diagonalizable. But I claim this happens for any  $a,b,c,d$  here, so we don't gain any new conditions on  $a,b,c,d$  here.  
 Thus, my final answer is that  $A$  is diagonalizable over  $\mathbb{C}$  only if one of the following occurs:  
 $1)$   $a,b,c,d$  are all equal to  $0$ ,    
 $2)$   $a,d \neq 0$  and  $b,c = 0$   
 $3$   $a,d = 0$  and  $b,c \neq 0$ 
 Is my solution correct? If not, where did I make an error in my logic? Is there any ways my solution can be improved?

"Background : 
 My plan is to get the overall euclidean distance matrix for all the vectors in N number of dataset. Each dataset is basically an array of n-dimensional points. For e.g: A dataset can be like [[1,2,3,...n],[1,2,3,..n],...[1,2,3,n]]. However, the datasets are not gonna be shared to a single entity for which I cannot compile them and thus will not know all the points to calculate pairwise euclidean distance for some similarity calculation and clustering analysis and modeling. However, I will be only notified what are the common vectors in the datasets and distance of the vectors in any dataset with respect to those common vectors without knowing or passing the point's coordinates.
If the dataset could be shared in the same model, I wouldn't have to face this distributed calculation problem. 
 Problem : 
 Given, 
 
 The euclidean distance between vector A and vector B 
 The euclidean distance between vector B and vector C 
 
 How to calculate the euclidean-distance between point A and C? 
 Thanks in advance.  
 Important to mention: 
So far I have been trying to use @AmanKushwaha mentioned formula to calculate the euclidean-distance between point A and C via Python script. Thankfully, it gives me the correct distance for 2-dimensional vectors. But as I stated above, instead of 2-dimensional vectors, each dataset can consist an array of N dimensional vectors where the value of N can be upto 20,000  (Please see the latest comments).

 How to calculate : $\frac{1+i}{1-i}$ and $(\frac{1+\sqrt{3i}}{1-\sqrt{3i}})^{10}$ 
 For some reason this is incorrect I'll be glad to understand why, This is what I done : 
 I used this formula : $(\alpha,\beta)*(\gamma,\delta)=(\alpha\gamma-\beta\delta,\alpha\delta+\beta\gamma)$ 
 And also : $(\alpha,\beta)*(\gamma,\delta)^{-1}=(\alpha,\beta)*(\frac{\gamma}{\gamma^2+\delta^2}-\frac{\delta}{\gamma^2+\delta^2})$ 
 
 $$\frac{1+i}{1-i}=\\(1+i)(1-i)^{-1}=\\(1+i)(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}i)=\\(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i^2}{2}+\frac{1}{2}i+\frac{1}{2}i)=\\(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}i+\frac{1}{2}i)=\\1+i\\ \\$$ 
 $$(\frac{1+\sqrt{3i}}{1-\sqrt{3i}})^{10}=\\
((1+\sqrt{3i})(1-\sqrt{3i})^{-1})^{10}=\\
((1+\sqrt{3i})(\frac{1}{1+3i}+\frac{\sqrt{3i}}{1+3i}i)^{10}=\\
(\frac{1}{1+3i}-\frac{\sqrt{3i}\sqrt{3i}}{1+3i}i+\frac{\sqrt{3i}}{1+3i}i+\frac{\sqrt{3i}}{1+3i})^{10}=\\
(\frac{4}{1+3i}+\frac{\sqrt{3i}+\sqrt{3i}}{1+3i})^{10}$$ 
 
 Now I want to use De-Moivre : 
 $$tan(args)= \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3i}+\sqrt{3i}}{1+3i})}{\frac{4}{1+3i}}=\frac{(1+3i)(\sqrt{3i}+\sqrt{3i})}{4+12i}=\frac{\sqrt{3i}-3i\sqrt{3i}+\sqrt{3i}+3i\sqrt{3i}}{4+12i}=\frac{\sqrt{3i}+\sqrt{3i}}{4+12i}$$ 
 But I reach to math error, when trying to calculate the args. 
 Any help will be appreciated.

"I have a bit of a unique problem. Well, maybe not a problem because I'm really just curious about it, but... 
 I have a simple 8 digit calculator. It has +, -, x, /, and a constant operation function. It has no usable memory slot. 
 I need (lit. would like to know how) to calculate ln(x) on this calculator. Any series I have found lose a lot of precision since whatever is outside the 8 digit range is truncated  without rounding . I have used Padé approximants with trig functions, and a continued fraction for exp(), but none of these two methods are adequate for ln(x), either because there is no way around the truncation error or it requires writing down many intermediate values, or it requires memorizing and punching in many constants. 
 Does anyone know any good way to calculate ln(x) (or any other base, since memorizing one constant is OK) to as many digits as possible as easily as possible on this calculator (bonus points to methods where the value on the screen is immediately, meaning you don't need to write it down)? 
 For that matter, if you happen to know some good ways to calculate other special functions, I am interested in that as well.

Somehow, I must construct from D two diagonal matrices $D_1 \in \mathbb C^{m\times m}$ and $D_2 \in  \mathbb C^{n \times n}$ and two invertible matrices $Q$ and $S$ so that $A=Q^{-1}D_1Q$ and $B=S^{-1}D_2S$, I don't know how to construct all these matrices.

what are the tightest known upper and lower bounds on the range of  $y$  at  $x$ ?
Additionally, is anything known concerning if and how many times  $y$   changes sign? Thanks in advance. 
 Edit:  I appreciate the quick responses on MSE. But I feel I should clarify what it is I'm hoping for. 
 1)  A concrete inequality for each bound. As an analogy or example, Robin gave the following upper bound governing his own famous inequality: 
 $$\sigma(n)-e^{\gamma}nloglogn<  \frac {0.6483n}{loglogn}$$ 
 so that given  $n$  one can quickly calculate a maximum value for the difference. Someone certainly must have made a similar computation for this Mertens asymptote.  
 2)  I think I may have read somewhere that it is not even known whether  $y$   in the original question changes its sign at all or whether it remains positive for all  $x$ . I have been unable to find that source again and was wondering if that is correct. 
 2nd edit:  After running a program to get a feel for this asymptote, I would just like to include the results here in order to share how quickly and nicely the product appears to converge to  $e^\gamma \;log(x)$ .

 The main question asks: Is there a known upper bound on the  5 th column strictly in terms of the  2 nd column, much in the same fashion as Robin's bound given above? 
 3rd edit Upon snooping around on MO, I came across this posting: 
 https://mathoverflow.net/questions/249147/mertens-3rd-theorem-upper-bound 
 With just a little reworking of the answer provided, it seems we have the following explicit lower bound from Rosser and Schoenfeld, thereby answering one part of the original question:
 $$-\frac{e^\gamma}{2\ln x}<\ \prod_{p\le x}\frac p{p-1}-e^\gamma\ln x\ <\quad?$$ 
 Obviously the question mark is my own as I am still seeking an explicit upper bound on the RHS. One would suspect it approaches zero far faster than the lower bound by considering the above table of values. 
 I'll try to gain access to the Rosser-Schoenfeld and Diamond/Pintz material, and if I come across an explicit upper bound will share it here.

"The area of the unit  circle  is $\pi$ and its circumference is $2\pi$. Consequently, many elementary methods for calculating and approximating $\pi$ use a geometric approach on the circle, such as bounding the circumference by sequences of inscribed and outscribed polygons with successively higher edge counts, or randomly sampling points from the unit square and then using the Pythagorean theorem to decide which of them lie within the unit circle to get an approximation of its area. 
 However, it is also true that the volume of the unit  sphere  is $\frac{4}{3}\pi$ and that its surface area is $4\pi$.

"I've been solving problems from my Galois Theory course, and I need help with some detail in this one. It says: 
 
 Calculate how many subfields has the splitting field of
 $P=X^7+4X^5-X^2-4$  over  $\mathbb Q$ . 
 
 What I first noticed is that  $P$  can be expressed as product of irreducibles as:
 $$P=(X-1)(X^4+X^3+X^2+X+1)(X^2+4),$$ 
so the roots of  $P$  are  $\{1,\omega,\omega^2,\omega^3,\omega^4,2i,-2i\}$ , where  $\omega=\cos\frac{2\pi}{5}+i\sin\frac{2\pi}{5}$ . Hence, the splitting field of  $P$  over  $\mathbb{Q}$  is
 $$\mathbb{Q}(1,\omega,\omega^2,\omega^3,\omega^4,2i,-2i)=\mathbb{Q}(i,\omega).$$ 
Now, I want to find  $\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(i,\omega)/\mathbb Q)$ , but to correctly find the automorphisms I first need to know the degree of the extension  $\mathbb Q(i,\omega)/\mathbb Q$  (then I would know that degree equals the number of automorphisms, since it's a Galois extension because  $\mathbb{Q}(i,\omega)$  is splitting field over  $\mathbb Q$  of a separable polynomial). My problem is finding this degree. I know
 $$[\mathbb Q(i):\mathbb Q]=2, \quad [\mathbb Q(\omega): \mathbb Q]=4,$$ 
but I'm not sure if the degree of  $\mathbb Q(i,\omega)/\mathbb Q$  is  $4$  or  $8$ . My intuition tells me the easiest path will be checking if  $i\in\mathbb Q(\omega)$  (implying degree  $4$ ) or if  $i\notin\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$  (implying degree  $8$ ). However, I don't figure out an easy way to prove this. 
 How can I find is  $i$  is or not inside  $\mathbb Q(\omega)$ ? Is there an easier way to find this degree? Any help or hint will be appreciated, thanks in advance.

"Problem 
 The premise is  almost  the same as in  this question . I'll restate for convenience. 
 
 Let  $A$ ,  $B$ ,  $C$  be independent random variables uniformly distributed between  $(-1,+1)$ . What is the probability that the polynomial  $Ax^2+Bx+C$  has real roots? 
 
 Note:  The distribution is now  $-1$  to  $+1$  instead of  $0$  to  $1$ . 
 My Attempt 
 Preparation 
 When the coefficients are sampled from  $\mathcal{U}(0,1)$ , the probability for the discriminant to be non-negative that is,  $P(B^2-4AC\geq0) \approx 25.4\% $ . This value can be obtained theoretically as well as experimentally. The link I shared above to the older question has several good answers discussing both approaches. 
 Changing the sampling interval to  $(-1, +1)$  makes things a bit difficult from the theoretical perspective. Experimentally, it is rather simple.  This is the code  I wrote to simulate the experiment for  $\mathcal{U}(0,1)$ . Changing it from  (0, theta)  to  (-1, +1)  gives me an average probability of  $62.7\%$  with a standard deviation of  $0.3\%$ 
 I plotted the simulated PDF and CDF. In that order, they are: 
 
 So I'm aiming to find a CDF that looks like the second image. 
 Theoretical Approach 
 The approach that I find easy to understand is outlined in  this answer . Proceeding in a similar manner, we have 
 $$
f_A(a) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2}, &-1\leq a\leq+1\\
0,           &\text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$ 
 The PDFs are similar for  $B$  and  $C$ . 
 The CDF for  $A$  is 
 $$
F_A(a) = \begin{cases}
\frac{a + 1}{2}, &-1\leq a\geq +1\\
0,&a<-1\\
1,&a>+1
\end{cases}
$$ 
 Let us assume  $X=AC$ . I proceed to calculate the CDF for  $X$  (for  $x>0$ ) as: 
 $$
\begin{align}
F_X(x) &= P(X\leq x)\\
&= P(AC\leq x)\\
&= \int_{c=-1}^{+1}P(Ac\leq x)f_C(c)dc\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\left(\int_{c=-1}^{+1}P(Ac\leq x)dc\right)\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\left(\int_{c=-1}^{+1}P\left(A\leq \frac{x}{c}\right)dc\right)\\
\end{align}
$$ 
 We take a quick detour to make some observations. First, when  $0<c<x$ , we have  $\frac{x}{c}>1$ . Similarly,  $-x<c<0$  implies  $\frac{x}{c}<-1$ . Also,  $A$  is constrained to the interval  $[-1, +1]$ . Also, we're only interested when  $x\geq 0$  because  $B^2\geq 0$ . 
 Continuing, the calculation 
 $$
\begin{align}
F_X(x) &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\int_{c=-1}^{+1}P\left(A\leq \frac{x}{c}\right)dc\right)\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\left(\int_{c=-1}^{-x}P\left(A\leq \frac{x}{c}\right)dc + \int_{c=-x}^{0}P\left(A\leq \frac{x}{c}\right)dc + \int_{c=0}^{x}P\left(A\leq \frac{x}{c}\right)dc + \int_{c=x}^{+1}P\left(A\leq \frac{x}{c}\right)dc\right)\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\left(\int_{c=-1}^{-x}P\left(A\leq \frac{x}{c}\right)dc + 0 + 1 + \int_{c=x}^{+1}P\left(A\leq \frac{x}{c}\right)dc\right)\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\left(\int_{c=-1}^{-x}\frac{x+c}{2c}dc + 0 + 1 + \int_{c=x}^{+1}\frac{x+c}{2c}dc\right)\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}(-x+x(\log(-x)-\log(-1)+1) + 0 + 1 + \frac{1}{2}(-x+x(-\log(x)-\log(1)+1)\right)\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\left(2 + \frac{1}{2}(-x+x(\log(x)) -x + x(-\log(x))\right)\\
&= 1 - x
\end{align}
$$ 
 I don't think this is correct. 
 My Specific Questions 
 
 What mistake am I making? Can I even obtain the CDF through integration? 
 Is there an easier way? I used this approach because I was able to understand it well. There are shorter approaches possible (as is evident with the  $\mathcal{U}(0,1)$  case) but perhaps I need to read more before I can comprehend them. Any pointers in the right direction would be helpful.

"Can you tell me if my answer is correct? It's another exercise suggested in my lecture notes. 
 Exercise: Consider $C[-1,1]$ with the sup norm $\|\cdot\|_\infty$. Let 
$$ W = \{f \in C[-1,1] \mid \int_0^1 f d\mu = \int_{-1}^0 f d \mu = 0 \}$$ 
 Show that $W$ is a closed subspace. Let $f(x) = x$ and calculate $\|f\|_{V/W} = \inf_{w \in W} \|f + w \|_\infty$ and show that the infimum is not achieved. 
 My answer:  
 To show that $W$ is closed we show that if $f$ is a limit point of $W$ then $f \in W$. So let $f$ be a limit point. Then there is a sequence $w_n \in W$ converging to $f$, i.e. for $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $w_n$ such that $\|f - w_n\|_\infty < \varepsilon$. Hence for $\varepsilon > 0$, $\int_{0}^1 f d \mu = \int_0^1 (f + w_n  - w_n ) d \mu \leq \int_0^1 |f-w_n| + \int_0^1 w_n = \int_0^1 |f-w_n| \leq \|f-w_n\|_\infty \leq \varepsilon$. Let $\varepsilon \to 0$. Same argument for $[-1,0]$. 
 Now we compute the norm:
$$ \|x\|_{V/W} = \inf_{w \in W} \|x + w\|_\infty = \inf_{w \in W} \sup_{x \in [-1,1]} |x + w(x)|$$ 
 $\|x + w\|_\infty$ is smallest for $w(x) = -x$. But $-x \notin W$.  
 I'm not so sure about the second part. Is this what is meant by showing that the infimum is not achieved? ""$\|x + w\|$ is smallest for $w(x) = -x$"" seems a bit... wobbly. Thanks for your help.

"Questions: 
 (1)  Calculate 
 $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\binom{2n}{n}$$ 
 (2)  Calculate 
 $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\binom{2n}{n} 2^{-n}$$ 
 without using L'Hôpital's rule. 
 Attempted answers: 
 (1) 
 Here I start by using the definition of a binomial: 
 $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\binom{2n}{n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{(2n)!}{n!(2n-n)!} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2n \cdot (2n-1) \cdot (2n-2) \cdot ... \cdot (n + 1) \cdot n!}{n! \cdot n!}$$ 
 Canceling one n! gives: 
 $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2n \cdot (2n-1) \cdot (2n-2) \cdot ... \cdot (n + 1)}{n!}$$ 
 Here I argue that, surely, the numerator grows faster than the denominator and so the result must be that the limit grows towards $\infty$. Is this sufficiently mathematically rigorous? 
 (2)   
 My first attempt looked at the binomial theorem in an effort to get the expression to look something like the general form: 
 $$(a+b)^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a^{k} b^{n-k}$$ 
 but it does not quite seem to match, since $k$ would have to be $0$ so that $a$ becomes $= 1$ does not interfere, but then $n-k$ would be $n$ instead. 
 My second attempt was to do what I did in (1), but then multiply it by $2^{-n}$: 
 $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2n \cdot (2n-1) \cdot (2n-2) \cdot ... \cdot (n + 1)}{n!} \cdot \frac{1}{2^{n}}$$ 
 Now we can cancel one of the $2$s in the $2^{n}$ for every second factor in the numerator since they (i.e. 2n, 2n-2) are divisible by 2. But there are n factors in the numerator, so at most $\frac{n}{2}$ factors can be canceled. 
 Issues: 
 (a) is my answer to (1) sufficiently mathematically rigorous? Is it really ""obvious"" that the numerator grows faster or are there additional arguments that should be provided for the argument to be convincing? 
 (b) what are some more productive approaches to question (2)?

"2019 has the exact same calendar (i.e. all days of the week coincide) as 2013. 
 I noticed this by simply looking at the actual printed out calendars. 
 However, this made me wonder how to calculate in general, for a given year  $Y_2$ , the closest year  $Y_1$  that had the exact same calendar. 
 In essence, I was trying to find  $Y_1 < Y_2$ , with  $Y_1, Y_2 \in \mathbb{N} $  such that the number of days between Jan 1st  $Y_1$  (included) and Jan 1st  $Y_2$  (not included) was a multiple of 7. 
 [Not sufficient: see Edit 1 below] 
 The number of days between those two dates is: 
 $N_{Y_2-Y_1} = 365 \cdot (Y_2 - Y_1) + number \ of \ leap \ years$ 
 For the number of leap years, I found  this post , so  I could write: 
 $N_{Y_2-Y_1} = 365 \cdot (Y_2 - Y_1) + \lfloor \frac{Y_2}{4} \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{Y_2}{100} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{Y_2}{400} \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{Y_1}{4} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{Y_1}{100} \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{Y_1}{400} \rfloor$ 
 I applied this formula to a simple  while  loop taking  $Y_2$  as input, and checking one by one the years before that until it found one for which the number of days was exactly divisible by 7. 
 This may be satisfactory from a numerical point of view, and it shows that the smallest distance between calendar-identical years can be 5, 6, 7, 11 or 12, with rather different frequencies for the various cases, 6 being the most frequent, followed by 5 and 11, then 12, then 7. 
 [WRONG: see Edit 1 below] 
However, it does not provide a 'closed form' for the calculation of  $Y_1$  given  $Y_2$ . 
 I looked at posts and other resources describing equations with floor functions (e.g.  this one  and  this one ), and while I sort of understood the concept for the examples given in those posts and could reproduce it, I could not quite fit it to my case. 
 I wonder if anyone could please provide some guidance? 
 I started with a simplified case, assuming that all years divisible by 4 are leap years (in fact I did not even know that century years not multiple of 400 were not leap years). The equation is then: 
 $N_{Y_2-Y_1} = 365 \cdot (Y_2 - Y_1) + \lfloor \frac{Y_2}{4} \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{Y_1}{4} \rfloor$ 
 For this quantity to be a multiple of 7, there must be an integer  $i$  such that: 
 $365 \cdot (Y_2 - Y_1) + \lfloor \frac{Y_2}{4} \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{Y_1}{4} \rfloor = 7 \cdot i$ 
 I.e., considering that  $365 \cdot (Y_2 - Y_1) = 7 \cdot 52 \cdot (Y_2 - Y_1) + (Y_2 - Y_1)$ : 
 $(Y_2 - Y_1) + \lfloor \frac{Y_2}{4} \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{Y_1}{4} \rfloor = 7 \cdot [i - 52 \cdot (Y_2 - Y_1)]$ 
 The first doubt I have is: given that  $i - 52 \cdot (Y_2 - Y_1)$  is an integer, can I replace it by another integer  $j$ , or does the fact that it contains my variables make this a wrong move? 
 I tried the methods described in the posts I linked above, namely substituting the quantities in each floor function with the sum of an integer + a 'fractional' quantity  $\in [0,1)$ , but I got rather knotted up, and in particular I could not eliminate the initial integer  $i$ , which however is not known a priori. 
 Could you please comment about my approach / suggest how I should proceed (for the moment focusing on the simplified case)? 
 Thanks! 
 
 EDIT 1  (after post by Hagen v E) 
 As pointed out by Hagen, even my numerical calculation was wrong, because it only checked that the starting weekday of  $Y_1$  was the same as the starting weekday of  $Y_2$ , not that the years were both leap or both non-leap. 
 After adding the leap-match check to the script, it turned out (unless I'm mistaken again) that in each 400 years cycle there are: 
 
 182 cases where the closest identical year occurs 11 years earlier 
 109 cases where the closest identical year occurs 6 years earlier 
 76 cases where the closest identical year occurs 28 years earlier 
 18 cases where the closest identical year occurs 12 years earlier 
 15 cases where the closest identical year occurs 40 years earlier 
 
 In the simplified case (considering all years divisible by 4 as leap years): 
 
 200 cases where the closest identical year occurs 11 years earlier 
 100 cases where the closest identical year occurs 6 years earlier 
 100 cases where the closest identical year occurs 28 years earlier 
 
 
 EDIT 2  (putting together the suggestions from the other users) 
 Following up from bloodflea's post below, and extending the method to the actual case considering non-leap century years. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong. 
 First, I define 3 conditions. 
 $a : \frac {Y_2}{400} = \lfloor \frac {Y_2}{400} \rfloor$ 
 $b : \frac {Y_2}{100} = \lfloor \frac {Y_2}{100} \rfloor$ 
 $c : \frac {Y_2}{4} = \lfloor \frac {Y_2}{4} \rfloor$ 
 Expanding all possible cases, and taking into account that: 
 $a \to b \to c$ 
 there are 4 possible (main) scenarios: 
 $A : c \land b \land a : Y_2 $  is a century leap year (like 2000) 
 $B : \bar c \land b \land a : Y_2 $  is a century non-leap year (like 1900) 
 $C : \bar c \land \bar b \land a : Y_2 $  is a non-century leap year (like 1960) 
 $D : \bar c \land \bar b \land \bar a : Y_2 $  is a non-century non-leap year (like 2019) 
 Given  $Y_2$ , I am looking for a function outputting  $Y_1$  as defined above. 
I define  $\Delta = Y_2 - Y_1$ . 
 In each case, each year in  $\Delta$  'brings'  $364 = 7 \cdot 52$  days, plus either  $1$  day (non-leap) or  $2$  days (leap). 
Thus  $\Delta$  will be a suitable value when the sum of these 'added' days is a multiple of  $7$   and  both  $Y_2$  and  $Y_1$  are of the same 'type' (leap or non-leap). 
 Case A: ( $Y_2$  century leap year) 
 The condition on the number of 'added' days is: 
 $\Delta + \lfloor \frac {\Delta}{4} \rfloor = 7 \cdot i, i \in \mathbb{N}^+, \Delta < 400$ 
 As  $Y_2$  is a leap year, the condition that both years are of the same type is: 
 $\Delta = 4 \cdot j, j \in \mathbb{N}^+, \Delta < 400$ 
 Putting the two together: 
 $4 \cdot j + j = 7 \cdot i$ 
 $5 \cdot j = 7 \cdot i$ 
 $j = i + \frac 2 5 \cdot i$ 
 The smallest  $i$  for which this is true is  $i = 5$ , resulting in: 
 $j = 5 + 2 = 7$ 
 $\Delta = 4 \cdot 7 = 28 < 400$ 
 Case B ( $Y_2$  century non-leap year) 
 The condition on the number of 'added' days is: 
 $\Delta + \lfloor \frac {\Delta}{4} \rfloor = 7 \cdot i, i \in \mathbb{N}^+, \Delta < 100$ 
 As  $Y_2$  is a non-leap year, the condition that both years are of the same type is: 
 $\frac {Y_1} 4 \ne integer, \Delta < 100$ 
 $\frac {Y_2-\Delta} 4 \ne integer, \Delta < 100$ 
 $\frac {-\Delta} 4 \ne integer, \Delta < 100$ 
 $\Delta \ne  4 \cdot j, j \in \mathbb{N}^+, 0 < \Delta < 100$ 
 I tried defining  $\Delta$  as  $4 \cdot j + 1$  etc, but I got nowhere, so I just tried out the first few values.  $\Delta = 6$  was the first that satisfied the two conditions. 
 Case C ( $Y_2$  non-century leap year) 
 Two sub-cases: 
C.1.  $100 \cdot \lfloor \frac {Y_2}{100} \rfloor$  is a leap year, i.e.  $\frac 1 4 \cdot \lfloor \frac {Y_2}{100} \rfloor$  is an integer 
C.2.  $100 \cdot \lfloor \frac {Y_2}{100} \rfloor$  is a non-leap year, i.e.  $\frac 1 4 \cdot \lfloor \frac {Y_2}{100} \rfloor$  is not an integer

"My question was put a little bit odd but it's kind of hard to explain what I am trying to do. I have 3 points defined in 3D space. They form a triangle and I am trying to find how does moving the points relate to the surface area of the triangle or with other words I am searching the gradient of the triangle's surface area given these 3 points.

"I am taking a non-normal distribution (Poisson, Exponential or Uniform etc.) and I simulate thousands of experiments for small sample sizes ($n=1,...,10$). I calculate the 95%-confidence interval each time, using:
$$I_{0.95}=\bigg(\hat{\mu}+z_{0.025}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \ \ \hat{\mu}-z_{0.025}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\bigg)$$
where $\hat{\mu}$ is my estimate for the mean (sample mean). I am also always assuming $\sigma$ is known (I am just taking it from the distribution I chose at the beginning). 
 Now, I have noticed a strange behaviour, namely, the estimates for confidece intervals are correct approximately 95% of them for whatever size of a sample. I thought that we should get a value around 95% only after, say, $n>30$. 
 Is this because the variance is known?

"I came across a weird property of the function  $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{(1-x)}$ 
 Observe the following:  
 $$f(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)}, \quad\quad f^2(x) = f(f(x)) = \frac{(x-1)}{x}, \quad\quad
f^3(x) = f(f(f(x))) = x$$  
ultimately implying that  $f^2(x)=f^{-1}(x)$ . 
 
 (Mini question: Do you know of any other functions  $g(x)$  where  $g \circ (g \circ g(x)) = g^3(x)=x$  aside from  $f(x)$  and aside from the trivial case where  $g(x)=x$ ? I was pretty shocked when I noticed this pattern with  $f(x)$ .) 
 
 
 Anyway, notice for every  $x$ , there is a set of triplets generated by repeatedly applying the function  $f(x)$ .  
 Specifically  $\langle x\rangle =\{x,f(x),f^{-1}(x)\}=\{x,\frac{1}{(1-x)},\frac{(x-1)}{x}\}$   
 For an illustrative example let  $x=2$ , so then  $\langle 2\rangle=\{2, -1, \frac{1}{2}\}$ . See now that this can be thought of as 3 points on the graph of the function  $f(x)$ , where 
 Point  $A$ :  $x \mapsto f(x)$ 
 Point  $B$ :  $f(x) \mapsto f^{2}(x)=f^{-1}(x)$ 
 Point  $C$ :  $f^{-1}(x) \mapsto x$ 
 
 Explicitly, still using  $x=2$  as the example:  
 Point  $A$ :  $(x, f(x)) = (2,-1)$ 
 Point  $B$ :  $(f(x), f^{-1}(x)) = (-1,\frac{1}{2})$ 
 Point  $C$ :      $(f^{-1}(x),x) = (\frac{1}{2},2)$ 
 
 OK so now my question!  
 
 Since 3 points uniquely define a circle, I'd like to know if we can derive a closed-form function  $r(x)$  that calculates the radius of circle  $R$ , where circle  $R$  is the circle uniquely defined by the 3 points  $A$ ,  $B$  and  $C$  generated by  $\langle x\rangle$ .  
 
 Continuing the example where  $x=2$ , circle  $R$  has center at Point  $R=(\frac{3}{4},\frac{1}{4})$  (i.e. the circumcenter of points  $A$ ,  $B$  and  $C$ ). The radius of circle  $R$  is then simply: 
 $$|\overline{AR}|=\sqrt{{\left(2-\frac{3}{4}\right)}^2+{\left(-1-\frac{1}{4}\right)}^2}= \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4}.$$ 
 So evaluating  $r(x)$  at  $x=2$  gives us  $r(2)=\dfrac{5\sqrt{2}}{4}\approx1.76777$ . 
 
 Another cool example to consider is  $x=\phi$ , where  $\phi=\dfrac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx1.61803$  (the Golden Ratio). Some cool characteristics that make  $\phi$  unique among all numbers are: 
 $$\phi-1=\frac{1}{\phi}\quad\text{and}\quad \phi+1=\phi^2$$ 
 You can calculate this on your own, but applying  $f(x)$  on  $x=\phi$  repeatedly results in  $\langle\phi\rangle=\{\phi,-\phi,\frac{1}{\phi^{2}}\}$ . 
 With the help of Wolfram Alpha, I was able to calculate  $r(\phi)\approx1.93649$ 
 (Circumcenter:  https://tinyurl.com/y59trfn5  | Radius:  https://tinyurl.com/y6jxs9sn ) 
 
 Calculating the circumcenter seems to be the biggest issue, but maybe there's a cleaner way with the help of linear algebra? I was reading that there's a way to calculate the formula of a circle using matrices and determinants, but that seemed too complex for this. Maybe circles and triangles aren't the way to approach this at all -- I'd be happy to take suggestions and hear your thoughts! 
 Just some last conceptual thoughts... 
 1)   $r(x)$  should always be positive (i.e. there is no  $x$  where  $r(x)$  is  $0$  or negative), and therefore somewhere hit some positive minimum value for  $r(x)$  (assuming/implying that  $r(x)$  is smooth and differentiable on the interval  $x \in (-\infty,1)\cup(1,+\infty)$ ). 
 2)  $\lim\limits_{x \to 1^-}r(x)=+\infty$  and  $\lim\limits_{x \to 1^+}r(x)=+\infty$ 
 3)  $\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty}r(x)=+\infty$  and  $\lim\limits_{x \to +\infty}r(x)=+\infty$ 
 4)  $r(x)$  is  NOT  symmetric around  $x=1$ . Just as a quick check,  $r(3)\approx2.12459$  and  $r(-1)\approx1.76777$ 
 5)  $r(x)$  is actual VERY NOISY as a function since for any 1 value of  $r(x)$ , there are at least 3 unique variables that result in that value (i.e. all  $x \in \langle x\rangle$ )(e.g.  $r(2)=r(-1)=r(\frac{1}{2})\approx1.76777$ ) 
 
 That last point makes me feel there's no true closed-form function for  $r(x)$ . Regardless, I'd be really curious to find out what the minimum radius is... (placing \$1 on  $r(x)$  for  $x \in \langle\frac{\pi^2}{4}\rangle$ !)

"Just playing around doodling today and I happened across two related sequences of numbers and I'm reaching out to understand what exactly is going on. 
 Sequence 1 
 The $n$th term of Sequence 1, $a_n$, is created by (illustration follows): 
 
 Writing $1,\ldots,n$, then $n-1,\ldots,1$ as the angled sides of an isosceles triangle. 
 Cells to the left of $n$ are equal to the sum of the two numbers below and to the left; cells to the right of $n$ are equal to the sum of the two numbers below and to the right. 
 Cells above $n$ are equal to the sum of the three numbers to the right, left, and below. 
 $a_n$ is the entry in the final cell--directly above $n$ and in line with both 1s. 
 
 For example, when $n=3$ we can fill in the triangle recursively like so: 
 1       1    1 3   3 1     1 3 13 7 1
  2   2   ->   2 7 2   ->    2 7  2   -> a_3 = 13
    3            3             3
 
 The first 7 terms of $a_n$ are 1, 4, 13, 36, 91, 218, and 505. This came up in OEIS as  A221882 : 
 
 The number of order-preserving or order-reversing full contraction mappings of an $n$-chain 
 
 With general form: $a_n=(n+1)2^{n-1}-n$. 
 For Sequence 1, I've got two questions: 
 
 How could one prove the general form from the construction of $a_n$ that I've given? 
 What is the relationship of this triangular sequence to the sequence described? (I have no idea what that description means) -or- is there any practical appearance of this sequence? 
 
 Sequence 2 
 Sequence 2, $b_n$, is almost identical to Sequence 1, except that on the right-hand side we continue counting up instead of counting down, that is, we fill in the bottom edges of the triangle with $1,\ldots,n,\ldots,2n-1$, then proceed to calculate $b_n$ as the final filled cell: 
 1       5    1 3   9 5     1 3 21 9 5
  2   4   ->   2 9 4   ->    2 9  4   -> b_3 = 21
    3            3             3
 
 The first 7 terms of $b_n$ are 1, 6, 21, 60, 155, 378, and 889. This came up in OEIS as  A066524 ; there's no simple description of this one. One of the candidate matches involves triangles, but I think constructed in a different way: 
 
 Form a triangle in which interior members $T(i,j) = T(i-1,j-1) + T(i-1,j)$. The exterior members are given by $1,2,3,\ldots,2n-1$: $T(1,1)=n, T(2,1)=n-1, T(3,1)=n-2, \ldots, T(n,1)=1$ and $T(2,2)=n+1, T(3,3)=n+2, ..., T(n,n)=2n-1$. The sum of all members will reproduce this sequence. For example, with $n=4$ the exterior members are 1 to 7: row(1)=4; row(2)=3,5; row(3)=2,8,6; row(4)=1,10,14,7. The sum of all these members is 60, the fourth term in the sequence. - J. M. Bergot, Oct 16 2012 
 
 The closed form for this is: $$b_n=n(2^n-1)$$ My questions for Sequence 2 are: 
 
 How can one prove the closed form above? Is there a direct relationship to $a_n$ above? 
 What is the relationship between this and the other appearances of this sequence mentioned on OEIS? Any practical use?

  \operatorname{Li}_2\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)
   & = -\int_0^\varphi \frac{\log(1-t)}{t}\,\mathrm{d}t 
     =  \phantom{-}\frac{\pi^2}{10} - \log^2\left( \Phi\right) \\
  \operatorname{Li}_2\left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)
   & = -\int_0^\Phi \frac{\log(1-t)}{t}\,\mathrm{d}t 
     =  -\frac{\pi^2}{15} - \log^2\left( -\Phi\right) \\
 \end{align*} 
 
 I am quite certain that these two special values can be shown by combining the  identites  for the dilogarithm, and forming a system of equations. But I am having some problems obtaining a set of equations only involving $\operatorname{Li}_2(\varphi)$ and $\operatorname{Li}_2(\Phi)$. Can anyone show me how to set up the system of equations from the identites, or perhaps a different path in showing these two values?

"If my maximum speed is $S$ and I make $1/3$ of a trip at $S/3$, and the rest of the trip at full speed, then what is my average speed in terms of $S$? 
 My impulse to calculate this was (1/3 * S) * 1/3 + S * 2/3 which is 7/9 of S, but this does not match a worked example that I did using actual numbers, so I am stumped how to make an equation for this. 
 For example, if the trip is 3000 units of distance and max speed is 30 units of speed, then for 1000 distance I go 10 units of speed, which takes 100 units of time, and the for the rest it takes me 2000 / 30 = 66.6 units of time, for a total time of 166.6. Thus, average speed is 3000/166 = ~18. This is different than 7/9 of 30 which is ~23. So, my method is wrong.

"The following problem appears at MIT OCW Course 18.02 multivariable calculus. 
 
 The top extremity of a ladder of length  $L$  rests against a vertical
  wall, while the bottom is being pulled away.  
 Find parametric equations for the midpoint  $P$  of the ladder, using as
  a parameter the angle  $\theta$  between the ladder and the
  ground (i.e., the  $x$ -axis). 
 
 And here is a sketch of the diagram for the problem. 
 
 We can find the parametric equations for the midpoint  $P$  by finding the vector  $OP.$  I write  $OP$  as a sum of two vectors  $$OP = OB + BP.$$ 
 We know how to calculate the two vectors  $OB$  and  $BP.$  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the first component of  $OB$  and the second one is obviously zero, hence  $$OB = \langle L \cos \theta, 0 \rangle.$$ 
 And by assuming that  $BP$  is the radius of a circle with center at  $B,$  we can find that  $$BP = \left \langle \frac{L}{2} \cos \theta, \frac{L}{2} \sin \theta \right \rangle.$$ 
 So, we find that  $$OP = \left \langle \frac{3L}{2} \cos \theta, \frac{L}{2} \sin \theta \right \rangle.$$ 
 But the professor's solution is  $$OP = \biggl \langle -\frac{L}{2} \cos \theta,\frac{L}{2} \sin \theta \biggr \rangle.$$

"I have already posted this on SO  here  with code however I'm really thinking that my line of thought (mathematical that is) is incorrect and that's why my code isn't working as intended so I decided to ask here since this is a mathematical problem. 
 I have a right circular cone with its tip ($\vec{tip} = (x_{tip},y_{tip},z_{tip})$) being the first point of the set of points and the center of the base being a point lying at the same $x$, $y$ coordinates but with $z$ equal to $0$ ($\vec{base} = (x_{tip},y_{tip},0)$). I have also a given angle between the cone's axis (tip to base) and the slant. 
 For every point in the set I have to check if it's inside the cone or not. For simplicity reasons I mark a point as valid if it is either really inside or at least lying on the cone's surface. A point is invalid if it lies outside. 
 In order to that I check two things: 
 
 Is the point above the cone?  - due to the range of values I have and the way I define my cone's base (at $z = 0$) a point cannot go below the cone's base (however it can lie on it in which case it is a valid one). This check is pretty simple. The height of the cone is already given by its tip (the first point from the set) so I just have to do a one-dimensional test comparing $z$ values. If the point is above the given height of the cone it is clearly outside. 
 
 $$
  checkHeightOkay(z) :
   \begin{cases} 
      yes & z_{point}\leq z_{tip} \\
      no & else
   \end{cases}
$$ 
 
 Is the point on the inside of/lying on the circumference of the slice of the cone at the given height or not?  - this test is a two-dimensional one. After making sure that the point is not above the cone (that is it's $z$ coordinate is okay) I calculate the slice of the cone at the height of the point (not that in my case the cone goes along the $z$ and not the $x$ axis as in the image below): 
 
 
 with the following formula for the radius: 
 $$\frac{r_{slice}}{z_{point}} = \frac{R_{cone}}{h_{cone}} \Rightarrow r_{slice} = \frac{R_{cone} \cdot z_{point}}{h_{cone}}$$ 
 For measuring if the point's  x and y  coordinates are part of this slice I use  Euclidean distance : 
 $$dist(\vec{axis_{cone}}, \vec{point}) = \sqrt[]{(x_{tip} - x_{point})^2 + (y_{tip} - y_{point})^2}$$ 
 And as a last step I check if $dist$ is $\le$ ( inside ) or $> r_{slice}$ ( outside ). 
 It seems however that this doesn't work since some points that are supposed to be valid are marked as invalid and vice versa (for more details and code you can check the link at the beginning of this post). 
 The algorithm is pretty straight forwards and I have really no idea what I'm doing wrong here.

"This is a follow-up question to  a post I made on Physics SE . TLDR; Essentially I have derived an apparent contradiction, starting from a simple integral. It feels like I'm missing something quite elementary and trivial, but I cannot seem to resolve it. 
 
 Consider the following integral, whose approximate form is commonly finds  in physics . 
 $$f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{dz}{\left(-z^2 + m^2 - i\epsilon\right )^2 \left(-(z-x)^2+ M^2 -i \epsilon\right)} \tag{1}$$ 
 $m,M>0$  are positive real numbers,  $x$  is a positive real number (which we may allow to be complex), and  $\epsilon>0$  is an infinitesimal small number which shifts the poles away from the real axis. In the complex  $z$  plane, the integral looks as follows: 
 
 The blue dots correspond to the double-poles at  $z=\pm (m - i\epsilon)$ , and red dots correspond to the single-poles at  $z=x\pm (M-i\epsilon )$ . The green line represents the integration contour.  Notice that the pole at  $z=x-M+i\epsilon$  resides in the  $1^{\textrm{st}}$  quadrant. 
 Now let's apply the technique of  Feynman parameterization , which combines both the rational terms in the integrand into a single rational function. 
 $$\begin{align}
f(x)&=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dz \int_0^1 du_1 \int_0^{1-u_1} du_2 \frac{2!}{\left[ 
 (1-u_1-u_2)\left( -(z-x)^2+ M^2 -i \epsilon \right)+u_2 \left( -z^2 + m^2 - i\epsilon\right) +u_3 \left( -z^2 + m^2 - i\epsilon \right) \right]^3} \\
&= \int_0^1 du_1 \int_0^{1-u_1} du_2 \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dz \frac{2}{\left[-(z-(1-u_1-u_2)x)^2-(u_1+u_2)(1-u_1-u_2)x^2+(1-u_1-u_2)M^2+(u_1+u_2)m^2-i\epsilon\right]^3} \\
&= \int_0^1 du_1 \int_0^{1-u_1} du_2 \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dz \frac{2}{\left[-z^2+g(u_1,u_2,x)^2-i\epsilon\right]^3} \tag{2}
\end{align}$$ 
 In the final expression above, note that no matter if  $g^2$  is positive or negative, the triple-poles will always lie in the  $2^{\textrm{nd}}$  and  $4^{\textrm{th}}$  quadrants. 
 
 Since no poles  $1^{\textrm{st}}$  and  $3^{\textrm{rd}}$  quadrants, we may rotate the contour counter-clockwise by  $90^\circ$ , also known as  Wick-Rotation . We now have the following expression: 
 $$f(x)=\int_0^1 du_1 \int_0^{1-u_1} du_2 \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} i dz \, \frac{1}{\left[z^2+g(u_1,u_2,x)^2 -i\epsilon\right]^3} \tag{3}$$ 
 Let's now reverse all the previous algebraic steps, but using the Wick-rotated expression. This will finally give us (compare with (1)): 
 $$f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{d(iz)}{\left(z^2 + m^2 -i\epsilon\right )^2 \left(-(iz-x)^2+ M^2 -i\epsilon\right)} \tag{4}$$ 
 But this is none other than the Wick-rotated version of the original integral! This is explicitly telling us that: 
 $$\int_{\Gamma_1} I(z) dz= \int_{\Gamma_2} I(z) dz \tag{5}$$ 
 where  $\Gamma_1$  is the contour along the real axis,  $\Gamma_2$  is the contour along the imaginary axis, and  $I(z)$  is the integrand in (1). Note that this is expression was derived by @QMechanic in the  PSE post mentioned previously . The essence of this derivation is found in most introductory textbooks on Quantum Field Theory. 
 On the other hand, if we tried to smoothly rotate the original contour by  $90^\circ$ , we would unavoidably pick up the residue of the pole in the  $1^{\textrm{st}}$  contour. 
 $$\int_{\Gamma_1} I(z) dz= 2\pi i \,\textrm{Res} \left(I(z);z=x-M-i\epsilon \right)+ \int_{\Gamma_2} I(z) dz \tag{6}$$ 
 Below you can see an illustration of this intuitive equation. 
 
 Combining (5) and (6), we see that the residue must be zero.  But we can calculate this residue and show it isn't zero, a contradiction! 
 $$\textrm{Res} \left(I(z);z=x-M-i\epsilon \right)=\frac{1}{2M\left(-(x-M)^2+m^2\right)}\overset{?}{\neq} 0 \tag{7}$$ 
 So what's going on here? How can I resolve this contradiction? 
 
 Edit 1: A possible resolution. 
 I've just realized an issue in the algebraic steps. In (2), as per @Maxim's comment, I shifted  $z\rightarrow z+(1-u_1-u_2)x$  in order to remove the term linear in  $z$ . This was fine, since  $x$  was real-valued. 
 However when reversing these steps later, going from (3) to (4), the equivalent shift would be  $z\rightarrow z+i(1-u_2-u_2)x$ . This is not valid since for arbitrary  $x$  the shift may hop over one of the poles! The resulting shifted-contour would not be homotopic to the original one! For it to be valid we would need  $x$  to be imaginary. 
 If we have analytic continuation in mind, we could simply assume at this step that  $x$  is actually purely imaginary. But then our original shift  $z\rightarrow z+(1-u_1-u_2)x$  would not be valid for the same reason!

 where $A$ is constant square matrix, $a$ and $b$ are vectors. Since the top-level expression is scalar the derivative should have matrix form. However, when I apply the chain rule I get:

"I'm writing a ""simulation"" of movable ""beings"". They have a target assigned to them, and each step, they move closer to their target position. 
 To calculate how far they need to travel each step, I'm using  atan  to calculate the angle that they need to travel at, and  cos / sin  to calculate the offset amount in each direction they need to move by. 
 Example: 
 If the being is at  [5, 5] , their target is at  [0, 0] , and they should move  2  units per step, they should move by  [-1.414 -1.414]  each step to get to their target. I don't want them moving [-5, -5] each step, as that would cause them to ""teleport"" everywhere. 
 My problem is the equation I'm using seems very convoluted. I had to partially relearn trig to do this, and I have a feeling I'm doing something wrong; though it gives the correct results. 
 My basic equation in a pseudo-notation: 
 let pos = [5, 5]
    targ = [0, 0]
    move-by = 2

    x-offset = (x of targ) - (x of pos)
    y-offset = (y of targ) - (y of pos)

    angle = atan(y-offset / x-offset)

    x-move-by = abs(cos(angle)) * signum(x-offset)
    y-move-by = abs(sin(angle)) * signum(y-offset)
 
 It's the last two lines I'm concerned about. They give the correct result, but the need to take the absolute value of what  cos  and  sin  return and then multiply by the sign of the offset in each dimension seems odd. I only came about it by tinkering, which of course isn't ideal. 
 When I simply tried: 
 x-move-by = cos(angle)
y-move-by = sin(angle)
 
 I would sometimes get correct results, but it would often cause the being to wander off in the ""mirrored"" direction. 
 Is there a simpler way of expressing this? 
 
 Here's the raw (Clojure) code in case the notation above isn't good: 
 (defn offsets-to-target [position target move-by]
  (let [[x-off y-off] (mapv - target position)
        angle (Math/atan (/ y-off x-off))]

"Introduction:   
 An exercise from ""Principles of mathematical Analysis, third edition"" by Rudin, page 78.  
 
 Exercise: 
 Calculate $\lim_{n\to\infty}(\sqrt{n^2+n}-n)$. 
 
 Explanation: 
 I have a hard time to grasp how to handle limits like this. I don't know how to start and what to look for. I've checked with mathematica and the answer should be $\frac{1}{2}$, and of course i've got the wrong answer. I find limits unintuitive. In the book, they proved ""the limits of some sequences which occur frequently"". The limits they proved were: 
 (a) If $p>0$ then $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n^p}=0$ 
 (b) If $p>0$ then $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{p}=1$ 
 (c) $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{n}=1$ 
 (d) If $p>0$ and $\alpha$ is real, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^\alpha}{(1+p)^n}=0$ 
 (e) If $|x|<1$, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n=0$. 
 When they proved all of the above theorems it felt like they used the fact that they knew the limits. For example: 
 
 Proof of (b): If $p>1$, put $x_n=\sqrt[n]{p}-1$. Then, $x_n>0$ and by the binomial theorem, 
 $$1+nx_n\leq(1+x_n)^n=p$$ 
 so that $$0<x_n\leq\frac{p-1}{n}.$$ 
 Hence $x_n\to 0$. And so on... 
 
 That is, I think they used the fact that the limit were 1 when they did put $x_n=\sqrt[n]{p}-1$. Before I compute a limit do I have to guess one? How can I do that when I don't think this is intuitive? Have you any tips how you do when you shall tackle a problem like this? How do you start when you want to compute a limit? 
 
 Solution: 
 This is how I did it: 
 $\sqrt{n^2+n}-n=\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n-1}-n=\sqrt{n}(\sqrt{n-1}-\sqrt{n})$. 
 Since $$(\sqrt{n-1}-\sqrt{n})\to 0\text{ when }n\to\infty.$$ 
 The product approaches $0$. Which is obviously not true. I did realise this after a while. Since one of the factor grows really big while the other gets really small and I guess they tend to take each other out, so it's pretty clear it shouldn't approach 0, but I don't think it's clear that it should approach $\frac{1}{2}$ either. Thanks for your help.

 How did they get $x(\sigma,\mathbb n)=e^{\sigma}\mathbb n$? I just cannot see where the $e$ came from, please forgive my stupidity but can someone please tell me how they got this solution? When i integrate i do not get this! 
 I will put the rest of the solution so the reader can follow, I am only stuck with the part mentioned though 
 Calculate $\sigma$ and $\mathbb n$ in terms of $x$ and $t$ (coordinate change) 
 $$ \sigma = t, \mathbb n = xe^-{t} $$ 
 Solve the compatibility condition $ \frac{\partial u}{\partial \sigma} = 0, u(0,\mathbb n) = f(\mathbb n) $. 
 Hence, $u(\sigma)=f(\mathbb n)$ 
 Hence we have $u(x,t)=f(xe^{-t})$

 ........... 
 For part (i) I think you use the conditional probability formula (P A given B) = P(A intersection B) / P (B). In this context, P(Found given British) = 0.7 and P(B) = 0.8 hence the answer is 0.8 x 0.7 = 0.56. Can someone confirm this? 
 For part (ii) I'm quite clueless about what to do

 (...)We know a priori that he is an excellent investor, and that he will be expected to earn a return of 15% in excess of Treasury bills, with a 10% error rate per annum (what we call volatility). It means that out of 100 sample paths, we expect close to 68 of them to fall within a band of plus and minus 10% around the 15% excess return, i.e., between 5% and 25% (to be technical; the bell-shaped normal distribution has 68% of all observations falling between -1 and 1 standard deviations). It also means that 95 sample paths would fall between -5% and 35%. 
 A 15% return with a 10% volatility (or uncertainty) per annum translates into a 93% probability of success in any given year. But seen at a narrow time scale, this translates into a mere 50.02% probability of success over any given second.

 Assuming that  $t > t_0$  and  $x(t_0) = x_{t_0}$ ,the formula used to calculate  $x(t)$  is the following: 
 $$x(t) = e^{A(t-t_0)}x_{t_0} + \int_{t_0}^t e^{A(t-\tau)}Bu(\tau) d\tau $$

 Students with the mean of grades above 4.5 
 
 Each  student  in  the  population  is  described  by  a  vector  of

  possible states:   $(1\ 0\ 0)^T$ if the student belongs to the first

  and $(0\ 0\ 1)^T$ if the student belongs to the third group.   The
  distribution of $x$ is categorical distribution (also known as
  generalized Bernoulli distribution or Multinoulli distribution) with
  parameters $\theta= (\theta_1\ \theta_2\ \theta_3)^T$. From the
  population of the students N examples were drawn. Calculate the
  maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta$. 
 
 I tried to do it similarly to Bernoulli case, but I'm stuck. The idea was to find $\theta^*$ by finding the maximum of probability distribution function. So my try was 
 $$
M(x\mid\theta)=\prod_{d=0}^D \theta_d^{x_d}=\theta_1^{x_1} \theta_2^{x_2} \theta_3^{x_3}\\
\theta^* = \operatorname*{argmax}_\theta M(x\mid\theta) = \operatorname*{argmax}_\theta \ln(M(x\mid\theta))\\
\ln(M(x\mid\theta))= \ln(\theta_1^{x_1} \theta_2^{x_2} \theta_3^{x_3}) = x_1\ln\theta_1 + x_2\ln\theta_2 + x_3\ln\theta_3 = x^T (\ln\theta_1\ \ln\theta_2\ \ln\theta_3)^T
$$ 
 Next step would be calculating derivative with respect to $\theta$ and finding it's zero, but we don't have $\theta$ in the function.  
 I'm not sure where is my mistake. Or perhaps there is no mistake and it is possible to convert $(\ln\theta_1\ \ln\theta_2\ \ln\theta_3)^T$ to some form with $\theta$?

 From this data I can calculate the sample mean, $\bar x$, and the standard deviation, sigma. 
 I get confused by the use of $n-1$ in the denominator of $\sigma$. So, I go away, look at Wikipedia, find out about Bessel's correction, slowly work my way through the maths and eventually learn to accept that, since $\bar x$ is calculated from the data, I only have $99$ independent comparisons of $x-\bar x$.  
 This makes a kind of sense. If I only have $1$ observation, there are no other data to compare it with. If I have $2$ observations, I have exactly $1$ estimate of the spread of the data, which is the spread of the data, and so on. I even understand that the sum of the absolute deviations must equal zero as the mean has been calculated from the data. 
 Great! I go away, happy with my calculations. 
 A week later, someone tells me that I was so thorough with my survey that   my ""sample"" was actually a census. I have taken measurements of absolutely every single living thylacine in the world. Suddenly, my sample average, $\bar x$ is actually the true population average $\mu$. Clearly, I now have to use the population standard deviation. 
 I go back to my calculation. The number of data is still $100$. The population average has still been calculated from the data. The sum of the absolute deviations still adds up to zero. I still have $n-1$ independent estimates of $x-\bar x$. 
 The data are identical. The algebra is identical. So when I calculate the standard deviation, why do I now divide by $n$, rather than by $n-1$? Where did the extra degree of freedom come from?

 If we associate both Point A and point B with a z value, then for any point P in the map, we can determine it's z value by interpolating between points A and B's z values. 
 So if P is right in between A and B, the z value will be the average of the two, if it's right on A it'll have A's z value etc. 
 (to calculate the z value, we just get the conjugate of the complex number (B - A), multiply that with (P - A) and get it's x value and then interpolate as usual. 
 But what about when there's 3 points, or 4 points? I gather 3 points can be done easily, I mean you can already picture the 3 points as forming a plane. 
 But how do I get the ""z"" value for 4 or more points? Because I'm using this for a game I'm developing, the 4 points would always be a polygon, and I need interpolated points that are inside an edge of the polygon (that is, right in between two neighboring points), to be in a straight line.. 
 My current approach right now is just to split the 4 points into two triangles, but I'd like to have something easier/faster on the CPU. Is there a way to come up with the interpolation without having to calculate each sub-triangle of the polygon? 
 p.s I have no idea what to tag this question as

"How many possible determinants are there for a  $3 \times 3$  matrix made of the numbers  $1$  to  $9$ ? Each integer from  $1$  to  $9$  must appear exactly once in the matrix (so that the matrix could appear inside a Sudoku grid). 
 Clearly, a lower bound is  $1$  (the matrices could theoretically all have the same determinant), while an upper bound is  $\frac{9!}{2}$  (the matrices could theoretically all have different determinants unless one is the transpose of the other). 
 Do not use Excel to calculate the determinants. Excel will incorrectly think that the matrix  $\begin{pmatrix} 1&2&3\\4&5&6\\7&8&9 \end{pmatrix}$  is invertible even though it is actually singular. 
 Since  $\begin{pmatrix} 1&2&3\\4&5&6\\7&8&9 \end{pmatrix}$  is singular, permuting the rows and/or columns would still give singular matrices. This leads to  $36$  such matrices, and taking the transposes would then double the count to  $72$ . So, one could improve the upper bound to  $\frac{9!-72}{2}+1=\frac{9!}{2}-35$ . 
 Also, even permutations of the rows or columns do not change the determinant, while odd permutations negate the determinant. Hence, applying a permutation of the rows and then a permutation of the columns with the same parity (even or odd) does not change the determinant. There are  $3$  even permutations of the rows and another  $3$  even permutations of the columns. Also, there are  $3$  odd permutations of the rows and another  $3$  odd permutations of the columns. So, the upper bound could be improved even further to  $\frac{9!-72}{36}+1=\frac{9!}{36}-1$ . 
 Other than that, I could not make the upper bound any better, nor the lower bound.

 So, let us consider very large necklaces with length $n$ and $n+1$.
I wonder about the limit of $N(n+1,a)/N(n,a)$ for $n \to \infty$. 
 Actually I started from the finding the limit for the number of fixed necklaces for infinity. It seems to me that it should looks like a generating function for the total number of inversion in combinatorial theory and some factor which includes a power and factorial of $n$. 
 If you can make a computer experiment to see the numbers for very large $n$, it'll be a great opportunity to think about the numbers as well.

"I'm doing complex analysis and I have the following $$\int_{C}\frac{2dz}{(2i+1)z^2+6iz+2i-1}$$ where $C$ is the unit circle. I tried factorizing this polynomial and find the residues but I really can't solve this. 
 This is my work:
$$z_{1,2} = \frac{-3i\pm \sqrt{-9-(-4-1)} }{2i+1}=\frac{-3i\pm 2i}{1+2i} \cdot \frac{1-2i}{1-2i}= \frac{-3i-6\pm 2i\pm 4}{5}$$ which gives $z_1 = -\frac{2}{5}-\frac{i}{5}$ and $z_2 = -2-i$. Now clearly $z_2$ is outside the unit circle so I just have to consider the residue of $z_1$. 
 However I think I'm either making a factorisation mistake or a mistake in the roots. Indeed if we check the roots, I don't get the same polynomial! $$(z+2+i)\left(z+\frac{2}{5}+\frac{i}{5}\right) = z^2 +z\left(\frac{12}{5}+\frac{6i}{5}\right)+\frac{4i}{5}+\frac{3}{5}$$ which is clearly not the same polynomial I started with. Also if I try to calculate the residue using the limit, I don't get the correct one. Where's my mistake? 
 EDIT 
 As requested, I'll add some more calculations. To calculate the residue I did the following: $$\lim_{z\to z_1}(z+\frac{2}{5}+\frac{i}{5})\frac{2}{(z+2+i)\left(z+\frac{2}{5}+\frac{i}{5}\right)} = \frac{2}{\frac{8}{5}+\frac{4i}{5}} = \frac{5}{4+2i} = \frac{20-10i}{20}=1-\frac{i}{2}$$ which is clearly wrong as this integral is the mapping of a real integral of the first type (rational function in sine and cosine). Indeed by Cauchy's Residue Theorem this should give that the value of the initial real integral is $2\pi i (1-\frac{i}{2}) = 2\pi i+\pi$ which is a complex value, so this is wrong

 Let's say you have N candidates, they are to be ranked by a 3 person committee. A candidate will be selected if they are ranked #1 by at least two people. Assume the members on the committee ranks the candidates randomly. Find the probability that a candidate will be accepted. 
 I am having a very difficult time starting. I have the correct answer but no idea how to calculate it. I approach all probability problems as such: What the is the total probability space i.e. total # of ways, and what are the # of desirable outcomes.  
 In this case my attempt is as follows: 
 Total probability space= # of different possible rankings. Which I reason to be $n!*3$ because let's say there are n candidates, candidate ""1"" can have a total of n rankings which leaves n-1 for the next, etc. There are 3 different lists; which is why I multiplied by 3.  
 So $3*n!$ should be my denominator. Now I calculate the # of desirable outcomes. A candidate could be ranked 1st by 2 or by 3 people. He can be ranked by 1st by 2 people 3 different ways, and 1st by 3 people in only 1 way. That gives me 4 totaL ways a candidate can be selected 
 Thus my answer is $4/(3*n!)$ 
 This is however, incredibly incorrect. The real answer is $(3n-2)/n^3$Could someone please guide me in the right direction?  
 Also fwiw: so far in the book it hasn't covered N choose K formulae, so I feel like I should be able to reason this out purely through counting.  
 EDIT: I have figured out the correct answer using simple probability math, HOWEVER, I would love it of somoene could help convert the answer into: desirable outcomes / total # of ways.  
 Answer: 
 Probability of being chosen= 3 ways of being chosen by 2 members + 1 way of being chosen by all 3

"Without using a calculator , how would you determine if terms of the form $\sum b_i\sqrt{a_i} $ are positive? (You may assume that $a_i, b_i$ are integers, though that need not be the case) 
 When there are 5 or fewer terms involved, we can try and split the terms and square both sides, to reduce the number of surds that are involved. For example, to determine if $$\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{7} > 0, $$ we can square both sides of $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{7} > \sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5} $ to obtain $$9 + 2 \sqrt{14} > 8 + 2 \sqrt{15}.$$ 
 Repeated squaring eventually resolves this question, as the number of surds are reduced. 
 However, when there are more than 6 terms involved, then repeated squaring need not necessarily reduce the terms that are involved. 
 E.g. How would you determine if  
 $$\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{11} + \sqrt{13} < 0 $$ 
 I can think of several approaches 
 
 There are special cases, which allow us to apply Jensen's inequality. However, this gives a somewhat restrictive condition on the set of values. 
 Show that $$ \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{13} < 7.26 < \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{11} $$
However, it might not be feasible to guess what the middle number is, unless you already had a calculator. 
 Calculate the surds to the appropriate level of precision (e.g. use Taylor expansion). This could be a little annoying. 
 
 Do you have any other suggestions?

 The virus has absolutely no symptoms to let anyone know whether they've been infected or not, before its too late.

"n white and k black balls are randomly and independently distributed amongst m boxes. There is no limit to the number of balls a box can contain. 
 As a result, there are four possible states for each box: 
 
 Empty 
 black only 
 white only 
 black and white 
 
 What is the expected fraction of boxes in each state given n, m and k? 
 Obviously the expected distribution of states depend on the expected frequency of boxes containing at least one black or one white ball, but I do not even know how to calculate that given that there are no restrictions on the number of balls in a box.   
 I had calculated this whithout taking into account the possibility that multiple balls with the same colour would end up in the same box. In that case it would simply be: 
 
 1 - α - β + α∗β 
 α − α∗β 
 β − α∗β 
 α∗β 
 
 with α = m/k and β = m/n. But this is obviously wrong if there is no limitation on the number of balls per box.

Let us call a number decreasing if its digits form a decreasing sequence (each digit is not larger than the preceding one). This means for example that 1, 22221111 and 888333300000 are decreasing numbers.  
 I know there exist infinitely many decreasing numbers as it does not many how many for example numbers 2 you take its digits  still form a decreasing sequence and therefore a decreasing number. The problem I ran into is when we want to calculate how many decreasing numbers of ten digits there are.

"We know that regular hexagons can tile the plane but not in a self-similar fashion. However we can construct a fractal known as a  Gosper island , that has the same area as the hexagon but has the property that when surrounded by 6 identical copies produces a similar shape, but with dimensions scaled by a factor of $\sqrt{7}$. 
 What is the distance between two of the centers? Is it the same as the distance between hexagons of the same area? ie. If I start with a hexagon of area A, then construct a Gosper island and place it next to an identical copy, would the distance still be the same as if they were hexagons? Or does the scaling factor come into play somewhere? Right now I think the answer is $\sqrt{3}/2$, as for the hexagon. 
 The reason I ask is that I'm trying to calculate the Gosper island's moment of inertia through an axis through its centre of mass and perpendicular to the plane of the island. 
 If we assume that the moment of inertia is always proportional to the mass, and proportional to the square of a characteristic length scale, then 
$$
I = \gamma Ml^2,
$$
where $\gamma$ is a constant, $l$ is the 'diameter' of the island, in a hexagon this would be the distance between two opposite vertices. Shrink the Gosper island by the scaling factor and surround it by six others. This self-similarity technique is super cute, and can be used to calculate the moment of inertia of  an equilateral triangle,  and can be extended to a square/rectangle quite easily. Fractals, having a high degree of self-similarity, seem amenable to this technique - here I calculate the  moment of inertia for a Koch snowflake. 
 $\hspace{1.3cm}$  
 Using the principle of superposition,
$$
I = I_{\text{centre}} + 6I_{\text{edge}},
$$
where
$$
I_{\text{centre}} =\gamma \frac{M}{7}\left(\frac{l}{\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \gamma \frac{Ml^2}{49} = \frac{I}{49}.
$$ 
 Now, by the parallel axis theorem $\displaystyle I_{\text{edge}} = I_{\text{COM}} + Md^2$ where 
$$
\displaystyle I_{\text{COM}} = \frac{I}{49}
$$
and $\displaystyle d= \frac{\sqrt{3} l}{2}  $ (this was one source of error), so
$\displaystyle I_{\text{edge}} = \frac{I}{49} + \frac{3Ml^2}{4},$ and
\begin{align*}
I &= \frac{I}{49} + 6\left(\frac{I}{49}+ \frac{3Ml^2}{4}\right), \\
I & = \frac{I}{7} + \frac{9Ml^2}{2}, \\
\frac{6I}{7} & = \frac{9Ml^2}{2}, \\
I & = \frac{21Ml^2}{4}.
\end{align*} 
 This seems incorrect? It feels wrong, comparing to a disk of radius $l/2$ which has moment of inertia $Ml^2/4$ it seems far too large.  
 It would also be nice if we could verify our answer numerically or otherwise. Any references are also appreciated.

"Question is :- 
 
 $n$ is a positive integer. Call a non-empty subset $S$ of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ ""good"" if the arithmetic mean of
  elements of $S$ is also an integer. Further Let $t_n$ denote the number of
  good subsets of $\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$. Prove that $t_n$ and $n$ are both odd
  or both even. 
 
 And my solution to this problem is :- 
 
 We deal with problem in 2 cases : n is even and other when n is odd.
  If n is odd , we first calculate n={1,2} by brute force. We get numbers
  of solutions for n=1 as 1 & n=3 as 5. Thus we conjecture that
  $t_n$=$t_{n-2}+2(n-1)$ for n as even. So by this recurrence we
  calculate $t_5$ which comes to be 15. A brute force manual calculation
  confirms this answer . Thus we prove our conjecture by induction. Now
  $t_1$ is odd (=1) so $t_2$ has to be odd since $t_2$=$t_1+2(3-1)$,here
  $t_1$ is odd & other term is even thus overall parity is odd. So $t_2$
  is odd. Again $t_3$ has to be odd as $t_3$=$t_2$+2(3-1), $t_2$ is odd
  & other term even , so $t_3$ is odd. So , inductively we conclude that
  $t_n$ has to be odd . For the other case we conjecture same recurrence
  relation and prove in the same way.

"Background: 
 I have two sets of coordinates/dimensions.  One for the red rectangle and one for the blue rectangle, as shown below.  The blue rectangle is quite simply the red rectangle transformed by a given scale factor. 
 
 Question: 
 Given that I know the coordinates for both the starting red rectangle and the resulting blue rectangle as well as the scale factor, how can I calculate the origin for this transformation? 
 e.g. 
 if the red rectangles coordinates/dimensions are as follows: 
 topleftX = 600
topleftY = 600
width = 400
height = 300
 
 And the resulting blue rectangle needs to have the coordinates as follows: 
  topleftX = 200
 topleftY = 200
 width = 2000
 height = 1500
 
 I can calculate simply that the scale factor is  5

 Let $f$ be the joint PDF of the random vector $(X, Y)$. 
 $f(x, y) = \displaystyle\frac{x(x-y)}{8}$ for $0 < x < 2$ and $-x < y < x$, otherwise it's zero. 
 Calculate the correlation between $X$ and $Y$. 
 
 The problem I'm struggling with here is that to compute the correlation, I need $E(X)$, $E(Y)$, $E(XY)$, etc.
I already calculated the $E(X)$, but when trying to calculate $E(Y)$, I get: 
 $E(Y) = \displaystyle\int_{-x}^xyf_y(y)dy$ 
 Where $f_y(y)$ is the marginal distribution of y, which I computed as: 
 $f_y(y) = \displaystyle\int_0^2\frac{x(x-y)}{8}dx = \frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}y$ 
 Because of the limits of integration when computing $E(Y)$, I assumed that the integral was going to be in terms of $x$, and in fact, I computed it and got $E(Y) = -\displaystyle\frac{x^3}{6}$. 
 Why is my expected value in terms of $x$? Is this the proper way to calculate this? Shouldn't be Y a random variable of it's own?

 How to calculate  $\lim_{x\to 0} \ (\sec x)^x$ ? 
 
 My attempt: 
 $$\lim_{x\to 0} \ (\sec x)^x =\lim_{x\to 0}\ \left(\frac{1}{\cos x}\right)^x =\left(\frac{1}{\cos 0}\right)^0 =1.$$ 
 We literally had to just input  $x=0$  in the expression, and we got the value easily. Now see what my book did. 
 My book's attempt: 
 Let  $y=(\sec x)^x$ . So,  $\ln y=x\ln (\sec x)$ . Then 
 $$\lim_{x\to 0} \ln y=\lim_{x\to 0} x\ln (\sec x)=0.$$ 
 So,  $\lim_{x\to 0} \ln y=0$ , or  $\lim_{x\to 0} y=e^0=1$ .

"Good day, 
 I have a question regarding geometry. I don't know whether my answer is correct because the answer in my book uses a totally different method for solving this particular problem. 
 Here's the problem: 
 Given is a triangle,  ABC , in which the middle of AB is also the middle of the circle drawn outside of the triangle. Finally, we draw a line from  C  to  M  where  M  signifies the point in the middle of  AB.  Now you have angle C sub 1 and angle C sub 2 ( together: angle C sub 12.) 
 We have created 2 equal-sided triangles, within the triangle  ABC , within the circle, namely:
triangle ACM and triangle BCM. 
 Proof that angle C sub 12 is equal to 90 degrees. 
 My answer:  
 Given: 
 AM = MC = MB (2 equal-sided triangles) 
 To Proof: 
 $$\angle C_{12} = 90^{\circ}$$ 
 Proof:
$$
\left.\begin{matrix}
 &  &  &  &  & \\ 
 &  &  &  &  & \\ 
 &  &  &  &  & \\
\angle A + \angle M_{1} + \angle C_{1} = 180^{\circ}\\ 
\angle B + \angle M_{2} + \angle C_{2} = 180^{\circ}\\
\angle M_{2} + \angle 2B = 180^{\circ} \\ 
\angle M_{1} + \angle 2A = 180^{\circ} \\ 
\angle M_{1} + \angle M_{2} = 180^{\circ}\\
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^{\circ} (= Q)\\
\\
\end{matrix}\right\}general
\\
$$ 
 Calculate for angle A and angle B: 
 $$ \angle M_{2} + \angle 2B = 180^{\circ}\\
\angle 2B = 180^{\circ} - \angle M_{2}\\
\angle B = 90^{\circ} - (\angle M_{2} / 2) $$ 
 $$and$$ 
 $$ \angle M_{1} + \angle 2A = 180^{\circ}\\
\angle 2A = 180^{\circ} - \angle M_{1}\\
\angle A = 90^{\circ} - (\angle M_{1} / 2) $$
Also:
$$
\angle M_{2} = 180^{\circ} - \angle M_{1}\\
\angle M_{1} = 180^{\circ} - \angle M_{2}  (= U)\\
$$
Now we can put angle A and angle B in the sum of angles (indicated by Q in general section.): 
 $$(90^{\circ} - (\angle M_{1} / 2)) +  (90^{\circ} - (\angle M_{2} / 2)) + \angle C = 180^{\circ}$$ 
 Now we substitute $$ \angle M_{1}$$ inside  $$((\angle M_{1} / 2)) $$ with U: 
 $$(90^{\circ} - (\frac{180^{\circ} - \angle M_{2}}{2}) + ((90^{\circ} - (\angle M_{2} / 2)) + \angle C = 180^{\circ}\\
(90^{\circ} - (\frac{180^{\circ}}{2}-\frac{\angle M_{2}}{2})) + (90^{\circ} - (\angle M_{2} / 2)) + \angle C = 180^{\circ}\\
90^{\circ} - \frac{180^{\circ}}{2}+\frac{\angle M_{2}}{2} + 90^{\circ} -\frac{\angle M_{2}}{2} + \angle C = 180^{\circ}\\
\Rightarrow 90^{\circ} + \angle C = 180^{\circ}\\
Conclusion: \angle C_{12} = 90^{\circ}
$$ 
 (not the prettiest proof but hopefully you get the idea.) 
 Here's the more concise ( and beautiful ) proof from the answers in my book: 
 $$\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^{\circ} \Rightarrow \angle C_{1} + \angle C_{2} + \angle C_{12} = 180^{\circ} \Rightarrow \angle 2C_{12} = 180^{\circ} \Rightarrow \angle C_{12} = 90^{\circ} $$

 Thanks!

"I've been looking for a way to intuitively find the formula to calculate the surface of a sphere, so here is my process of thinking: 
 
 In 2D: you imagine a segment of length R that rotates around an axis which corresponds to the center of the circle (Ω). The total angle formed by the revolution is 2π, so your formula is 2πR. 
 In 3D: by analogy with 2D you imagine a circle on a plane, and you apply a similar rotation centered on Ω also directed by your radius of length R. And you get a sphere! The total angle formed by the revolution is π so by this logic the formula for the surface of the sphere you would get would be 2π²R²... 
 
 But when I searched on the net about the formula I found that it was 4πR², and all the demonstrations explaining the formula use integrals (which I only know how to use on a plane).  
 So I would like to know where I'm wrong in my reasoning and how to demonstrate (not rigorously) this formula using simple geometry tools and a bit of imagination.

 Considering how to calculate  $n$ -th roots of a complex number in polar form, find the vertices of a square of center  $0$  knowing that one of them is  $(3,4)$ . 
 
 
 Ok so I don't know how to express the equation. I know that  $w\in\Bbb{C}$  is a  $n$ -rooth of  $z\in\Bbb{C}$  iff  $z=w^n$ . 
 In this case we have  $n=4$  (because it is a square) and  $v_1=3+4i=[5,\arctan(4/3)]$ , so  Question: the equation becomes  $z=v^4$ ? 
 Now call  $z=[\rho,\varphi]$  and  $v=[r,\theta]$ . We need to find all  $v$  such that  $z=v^4$ , i.e.  $v_k$  for  $k\in[1,4]$ . 
 Then  $v^4=[r^4,4\theta]$ , so by equality of complex numbers in polar coordinates, we have  $\rho=r^4$  and  $4\theta=\varphi+2k\pi$ . Then  $v_k=[\sqrt[4]{\rho},(\varphi+2k\pi)/4]$ . 
 Since  $v_1=[5,\arctan(4/3)]$  and for the calculated formula  $v_1=[\sqrt[4]{\rho},(\varphi+2\pi)/4]$ , then  $5=\sqrt[4]{\rho}$  and  $\arctan(4/3)=(\varphi+2\pi)/4$ , hence  $\rho=625$  and  $\varphi=4\arctan(4/3)-2\pi$ . 
 From here I don't know how to proceed. 
 Question: How do we calculate  $v_2,v_3$  and  $v_4$ ?  We could use the polar form of  $v_k$  to also find  $v_1$  to check if the formula is correct. 
 EDIT  I think my calculations are correct! We end up with  $$v_k=\left[5,\frac{4\arctan(4/3)-2\pi+2k\pi}{4}\right]$$  so:  $$v_1=[5,\arctan(4/3)]=(3,4)\\
v_2=[5,(4\arctan(4/3)-2\pi+4\pi)/4]=(-4,3)\\
v_3=[5,(4\arctan(4/3)-2\pi+6\pi)/4]=(-3,-4)\\
v_4=[5,(4\arctan(4/3)-2\pi+8\pi)/4]=(4,-3).$$

 how to get a  fast  and acceptable approximation to distance? 
 is this way ok?

 FAST APPROXIMATED HYPOTENUSE WITHOUT SQUARED ROOT FOR DISTANCE CALCULATIONS 
 i inspired this formula in quake3 ""fast inverse square root"" 
 let's consider a right triangle with ""A"" as long cathetus and ""B"" as short one, 
      B
 +-------
 |      /
 |     /
A|    /
 |   /H
 |  /
 | /
 |/
 
 we can take a proportional triangle with long catetus 1 and short one
variable by dividing B/A 
  b = B/A
 +-----
 |    /
1|   /
 |  /h
 | /
 |/
 
 we can find a value to operate with b to find the hypotenuse ""h"", that later    could multiply with ""A"" to find original hypotenuse lenght ""H"" 
 the function of hypotenuse against short leg is 
       ______
     /     2
h = V 1 + b


  |        ,´

 i noticed this curve looks similar to an hyperbola, which involves division
i believe this should be the better approximation
but my current math knowledge does not allow me to follow this calculatations 
 i think it also looks like the zone of a parabol near the foci 
 i want to find a value ""V"" in function of ""b""
so that multiplying ""b*V"" finds a good approximation of ""h"" 
 i found that the approximated equation ""h ~= 1 + 0.43b^2 ""
satisfies fairly well the problem between range 0 <= b <= 1 
                       ______
             2       /     2
    1 + 0.43b   ~=  V 1 + b
 
 i think the curves looks very similar in specified range, so summarizing
with A (longer) and B being right triangle legs and H being hypothenuse we got 
 b = B/A
2
H ~= A (1 + 0.43b ) 
 until does not fit perfectly is ok for me since i just use it for information
(a minecraft plugin that prints the approximated distance between 2 portals)
maybe a correction could be added later by someone else (graph made it with geogebra online calculator) 
 
 i found the max differences are about 0.015 (1.5%) in x~=0.6 and x=1, not so high for just informational info... maybe if you are driving a car and a road sign says ""destTown: 203km"" instead ""200km"" the difference is negligible, at 100km/h you will reach the town in 2:00 instead 2:02 
 would be useful if someone finds a more precise method with just basic operations (+-*) (no roots, trigonometry, logarithms or expensive ones) or huge lookup tables, at most a 2nd degree equation with a constant as it was for fast inverse square root

"If I randomly select subsets $K$ and $R$ of set $N$, what is the expected value of $|K \cap R|$ i.e. the number of elements in both $K$ and $R$? 
 EDIT: Clarifications: $N$ is finite and of known size, and $K$ and $R$ are uniformly distributed  over subsets of given sizes $k$ and $r$.  In other words, I'm looking for a function $P(k, r, n)$ that returns $|K \cap R|$.  
 I initially tried modelling this as a computation. If I select an element from $R$ and try to add it to $K$, the probability that said element is already in $K$ is $\frac{k}{n}$ ($k = |K|$; $n = |N|$; $r = |R|$). So the expected number of elements in $K$ after I add an element from $R$ should be $\frac{k}{n} k + \frac{n - k}{n} \left ( k + 1 \right )$. Following this train of logic gives us the recurrence relation 
 $P(k, r, n) = \frac{k}{n} P(k, r - 1, n) + \frac{n - k}{n} P(k + 1, r - 1, n)$ 
 with the obvious boundary conditions $\forall k, n: P(k, 0, n) = 1$ and $\forall n, r: P(n, r, n) = 0$. (Finding $P(k, r, n)$ will obviously give us $|K \cup R|$, not $|K \cap R|$, but then $|K \cap R| = |K| + |R| - |K \cup R|$.) But I have no idea how to turn this recurrence relation into a closed-form, and I'm not even fully confident that it's correct in the first place. I would just write a C program to calculate $P(k, r, n)$ for me, but I'm dealing with values of $k$ and $r$ that are large enough (up to $2^{16}$) that I would blow my stack space.

"I tried to find the volume of a square-pyramid using integration by summing up triangular prisms, but for some reason I am not getting the right answer. 
 Below is my approach: 
 Suppose I place my triangular prism on an (x,y,z) coordinate system where one side of the base is co-linear to my x-axis, and the other side is co-linear to the y-axis.  
 I can create a linear equation that represents the height of my pyramid at a particular point x which passes through the summit of the pyramid. That is, I know that when x=0, y=0, and when x= $\frac{b}{2}$ , y=h.  
 Therefore the equation of the line is y= $\frac{2h}{b}x$ . The area of a triangular prism is  $A_b \times thickness$ . To calculate the volume of the pyramid, my approach is to just sum up a bunch of thin triangular prisms. 
 For a particular value x between 0 and  $\frac{b}{2}$ , the volume of a triangular prism slice would be  $\frac{b2hx}{2b}dx$ , which simplifies to  $hxdx$ . 
 We then integrate between 0 and  $\frac{b}{2}$  which gives us the volume up to the summit, and multiply by 2 because of symmetry. 
 $2\int_0^\frac{b}{2}hxdx=2h\int_0^\frac{b}{2}xdx=2h\frac{b^2}{8}=\frac{1}{4}hb^2$ 
 Where did I go wrong in my approach of summing triangular prisms together? Or is it that triangular prisms somehow do not work for finding volumes?

"Question: 
 $$\int_0^{4\pi}\frac{dx}{5+4\cos x} $$ 
 My approach:   
 First I calculated the antiderivative as follows:   
 Using:  $\cos\theta= \frac{1-\tan^2\frac{\theta}{2}}{1+\tan^2\frac{\theta}{2}}$  we have: 
 $\int\frac{dx}{5+4\cos x}=\int\frac{dx}{5+4\frac{1-\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}{1+\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}}=\int\frac{1+\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}{5+5\tan^2\frac{x}{2}+4-4\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}dx=\int\frac{\frac{1}{\cos^2 \frac{x}{2}}}{3^2+\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}dx$ 
 Using substitution we have:   
 $u=\tan\frac{x}{2}$ 
 $du=\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{\cos^2\frac{x}{2}}dx$   
 $2\int\frac{\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{\cos^2 \frac{x}{2}}}{3^2+\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}dx=2\int\frac{du}{3^2+u^2}=\frac{2}{3}\arctan\frac{u}{3}+\mathscr{C}=\frac{2}{3}\arctan\frac{\tan\frac{x}{2}}{3}+ \mathscr{C}$ 
 Now we can calculate the definite integral as follows:   
 $\int_0^{4\pi}\frac{dx}{5+4\cos x} = \frac{2}{3}\arctan\frac{\tan\frac{x}{2}}{3}\bigl|_0^{4\pi}=\frac{2}{3}(\arctan\frac{\tan\frac{4\pi}{2}}{3}-\arctan\frac{\tan\frac{0}{2}}{3})=0$   
 The result I get is  $0$  but the correct one is  $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ .  Can someone explain me why?   
 Here it shows that the correct answer is  $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ .

"When we had the circle in math (a while ago) our math teacher said we should try to find a way to calculate the area of a circle. My friend and I came up with a way to do this: you had to square  $d$  and then multiply it with an universal number to get the area of the circle. 
 $$A=d^2\cdot x$$   
 Our first idea to get the number was by weighing the square  $d^2$ (for example as a wooden plate) and then cut a circle out, which you had to weigh too. These numbers had to be divided to get the 'universal number'.
After that, our teacher told us the formula to calculate the area of a circle, which was  $A=r^2\pi$ . 
 Later on I tried to get the number by dividing  $ r^2\pi$  (which is the exact area of a circle) with  $d^2$ . The result was an irrational number:
 $$x\approx 0.785398$$

"Suppose we want to calculate  $\tan^{-1}x-\tan^{-1}y$  for  $\forall~x,y$ 
 We already know  $\tan^{-1}x-\tan^{-1}y=\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}$  for  $x>0$  and  $y>0$ , but we will not make use of it as we have to prove for  $\forall$   $x,y$ 
 $$\tan^{-1}x-\tan^{-1}y=\theta\tag{1}$$ 
 Let's find range of  $\theta$ , assuming  $x$  and  $y$  to be independent variables 
 $$\theta\in(-\pi,\pi)$$   
 Taking  $\tan$  on both sides of equation  $1$ 
 $$\dfrac{\tan(\tan^{-1}x)-\tan(\tan^{-1}y)}{1+\tan(\tan^{-1}x)\cdot \tan(\tan^{-1}y)}=\tan\theta$$ 
 $$\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}=\tan\theta$$ 
 Taking  $\tan^{-1}$  on both sides 
 $$\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}=\tan^{-1}(\tan\theta)$$ 
 $$\tan^{-1}(\tan\theta)=\begin{cases}

    \theta,&-\dfrac{\pi}{2}<\theta<\dfrac{\pi}{2} \\
    -\pi+\theta, & \dfrac{\pi}{2}<\theta<\pi

 So 
 $$\theta=\begin{cases}

    \tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy},&-\dfrac{\pi}{2}<\theta<\dfrac{\pi}{2} \\

    \pi+\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}, & \dfrac{\pi}{2}<\tan^{-1}x-\tan^{-1}y<\pi

 $$\tan^{-1}x-\tan^{-1}y=\begin{cases}

    \pi+\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}, & \tan^{-1}x-\tan^{-1}y\in\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2},\pi\right)
  \end{cases}$$ 
 $$\tan^{-1}x-\tan^{-1}y=\begin{cases}
    -\pi+\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}, & \dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}\in\left(0,\infty\right)\\

 $$\tan^{-1}x-\tan^{-1}y=\begin{cases}

 Let's take a look at first branch   
 $\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}>0$ , only in two following cases 
 Case  $1$ : 
 $x>y$  and  $xy>-1$ 
 In this case, L.H.S=  $\tan^{-1}x-\tan^{-1}y$  will be positive as  $\tan^{-1}$  is increasing function but R.H.S= $-\pi+\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}$  is always negative because range of  $\tan^{-1}$  is  $\left(-\dfrac{\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)$ . So we got contradiction in this case 
 Case  $2$ : 
 $x<y$  and  $xy<-1$   $\implies$   $x<0$  and  $y>0$  (just determining the sign of  $x$  and  $y$ ) 
 So in this case this branch looks perfectly valid. 
 Let's take a look at third branch 
 $\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}<0$ , only in two following cases  
 Case  $1$ : 
 $x<y$  and  $xy>-1$ 
 In this case, L.H.S=  $\tan^{-1}x-\tan^{-1}y$  will be negative as  $\tan^{-1}$  is increasing function but R.H.S= $-\pi+\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}$  is always positive because range of  $\tan^{-1}$  is  $\left(-\dfrac{\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)$ . So we got contradiction in this case 
 Case  $2$ : 
 $x>y$  and  $xy<-1$   $\implies$   $y<0$  and  $x>0$  (just determining the sign of  $x$  and  $y$ ) 
 So in this case this branch looks perfectly valid. 
 Let's take a look at second branch 
 This branch looks perfectly valid for all cases, but let's see if is it actually? 
 Case  $1$ :   $x>0,y>0$ ,  $x>y$ 
 L.H.S is positive and R.H.S is also positive, perfectly valid. 
 Case  $2$ :   $x>0,y>0$ ,  $x<y$ 
 L.H.S is negative and R.H.S is also negative, perfectly valid. 
 Case  $3$ :   $x<0,y<0$ ,  $x>y$ 
 L.H.S is positive and R.H.S is also positive, perfectly valid. 
 Case  $4$ :   $x<0,y<0$ ,  $x<y$ 
 L.H.S is negative and R.H.S is also negative, perfectly valid. 
 Case  $5$ :   $x>0,y<0$ ,  $xy>-1$  and  $xy<0$ 
 L.H.S is positive and R.H.S is also positive, perfectly valid. 
 Case  $5$ :   $x>0,y<0$ ,  $xy<-1$ 
 L.H.S is positive and R.H.S is negative, got contradiction. 
 Case  $7$ :   $x<0,y>0$ ,  $xy<-1$ 
 L.H.S is negative and R.H.S is positive, got contradiction. 
 Case  $8$ :   $x<0,y>0$ ,  $xy>-1$  and  $xy<0$ 
 L.H.S is negative and R.H.S is negative, perfectly valid. 
 So finally we can write  
 $$\tan^{-1}x-\tan^{-1}y=\begin{cases}
    -\pi+\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}, &x<0 \text{ and } y>0 \text { and } xy<-1\\
    \pi+\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}, & x>0 \text{ and } y<0 \text { and } xy<-1\\
   \tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy},& \text{ otherwise }
  \end{cases}$$ 
 One can also derive  $\tan^{-1}x+\tan^{-1}y$  by the above formula 
 $$\tan^{-1} x+\tan^{-1} (-y)=\begin{cases}
    -\pi+\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}, &x<0 \text{ and } y>0 \text { and } xy<-1\\
    \pi+\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy}, & x>0 \text{ and } y<0 \text { and } xy<-1\\
   \tan^{-1}\dfrac{x-y}{1+xy},& \text{ otherwise }
  \end{cases}$$ 
 Replace  $y$  by  $-y$ 
 $$\tan^{-1} x+\tan^{-1} (y)=\begin{cases}
    -\pi+\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x+y}{1-xy}, &x<0 \text{ and } -y>0 \text { and } -xy<-1\\
    \pi+\tan^{-1}\dfrac{x+y}{1-xy}, & x>0 \text{ and } -y<0 \text { and } -xy<-1\\
   \tan^{-1}\dfrac{x+y}{1-xy},& \text{ otherwise }

"I'm working on a problem for an online judge and I'm stuck.   I'd like a nudge in the right direction (not an outright solution, please), relevant references, theorems, etc.   After reading through relevant entries here and on the web, I believe the correct mathematical statement of the problem is to count the exact number of elements in a subset of a numerical semigroup $\lbrace a, b \rbrace$ (the set of all linear combinations of $a,b$ with non-negative integer coefficients).  Specifically, to count the element of set $S$:
\begin{equation}
S = \lbrace x \vert x \in \lbrace a,b \rbrace, X_{min} \le x \le X_{max} \rbrace
\end{equation}
The range of possible values is: $1 \le a, b, X_{min}, X_{max} \le \approx 2^{63}$.  With these sizes, only a closed form $O(1)$ solution will do.  I already have a solution for the cases: $a=b$ (trivial) and $b = a + 1$ (not trivial but not too challenging, interesting case).   From the answers to this question:  Determine the Set of a Sum of Numbers , I suspect some sort of generalization of the gap counting formula for the case where $gcd(a,b)=1$: $gaps=(a-1)(b-1)/2$, to be able to quickly calculate the number of gaps below an arbitrary $x$ is the key for answering this question.    
 What I've noticed so far: I've investigated trying to find a pattern for the gaps between successive multiples of $a$ (assuming $a<b$).   I've noticed that each multiple of $b$ occupies one of the $(a-1)$ positions between multiples of $a$, and that the $(a-1)$th multiple of $b$ fills that last gap.  The first $b$ fills position $b_a$ and the next multiple of b occupies $(b_a + (b-a)_a)_a$.  But I haven't been able to generalize anything from that yet. 
 (My math background is undergraduate level calculus (2 years), linear algebra/matrix theory, discrete math (for CS students), and a real analysis course, but no number theory.)   Thanks for any hints / pointers!

 The region  $P$  is bounded by the curve  $y= 3x-x^2$  , the  $x$ -axis and the line  $x=a$  . The region  $Q$  is bounded by the curve  $y= 3x-x^2$  , the  $x$ -axis and the lines  $x=2a$  and  $x=a$ . Given that the area of  $Q$  is twice the area of  $P$ , find the value of  $a$  . 
 
 
 Firstly , on the first step , in already stuck ... 
 I used definite integral to find the area of  $P$  - 
 $$\int^a_0\ (3x-x^2)dx=\frac{9a^2-2a^3}{6}$$ 
 However when I calculate area of  $Q$  , it's the same as Area of  $P$  -  $$\frac{9a^2-2a^3}{6}$$ 
 Then since 
 $Q= 2P$ 
 $9a^2 - 2a^3 = 18a^2 - 4a^3 $ 
 From here, I definitely can't find the value of  $a$  ... where have I gone wrong or misunderstood ?

"MOTIVATION 
 I am considering investing a significant amount of money into a raffle. In order to decide the number of entries I purchase, I would like to find probability distributions for the number of prizes I will win with respect to the number of entries I purchase. 
 HOW THE RAFFLE WORKS 
 Total entries: 1000 
 Winning entries (# of prizes): 20 
 How it actually works is in 20 rounds of 50 entries.  
 
 Entries 1-50 have a 1/50 chance to win prize 1 
 Entries 51-100 have a 1/50 chance to win prize 2 
 
 ...  
 
 Entries 951-1000 have a 1/50 chance to win prize 20 
 
 The entry numbers are purchased in order, so technically if I can get entries 1-50 then I have a 100% chance to win prize 1. However, I don't expect I will be able to do this since many people will be trying to buy entries at the same time. For simplicity, perhaps we can just assume that my entries will be evenly distributed across all 20 rounds (see  BONUS  below for my thoughts on how this change impacts the solution and please correct me if I am wrong). 
 INITIAL THOUGHTS 
 From some quick research I think the estimate for my odds of winning ONE prize is approximately like this: 
 1 - [ (1000-n) / 1000 ]^20 
 where n = number of entries I purchase 
 WHAT I WANT TO KNOW 
 What I actually want is how to calculate the probability distribution of the number of prizes I win. So not just whether I win 1 prize or not. 
 Given n where n is the number of entries I purchase, I want to know the average (mean) number of prizes I should expect to win and the surrounding distribution. This way I can decide my risk tolerance and choose how many entries (n) it is worth it for me to buy. 
 BONUS 
 I mentioned we can simplify the problem to assume my entries will be even distributed across all 20 rounds, but I am curious what the optimal strategy would be if I could choose my entry numbers. 
 For example, if n = 100 entries, is it best to buy entries 1-100 and have a 100% chance to win 2 prizes? Or would having a more even distribution be better. For example, having 5 entries in each of the 20 rounds ? 
 In other words, I could have: 
 
 100% chance to win in 2 rounds (win 2 prizes) and 0% chance to win in
the other 18 rounds 
 10% chance to win in all 20 rounds 
 
 My understanding is that in both cases my expected number of wins is 2. The difference is that in the first case it is guaranteed whereas in the second place I could get lucky and win more or unlucky and win less. Correct? 
 Extrapolating from that, it seems like the more evenly distributed the entry numbers are across rounds, the more uncertainty in the number of prizes I will actually win. However, the expected number (mean) of the distribution should always be the same. Is this true?

"I'm not a mathematician, so the description of my problem might seem a little verbose: 
 In a multiple-choice test there is a set of three questions and a set of five possible answers. To each of the three questions one of the five answers is the correct one. No answer can be assigned twice. So three of the  $5$  answers will be assigned to one of the three questions and two answers will be left.
I would now like to calculate the average score that would result from random answers if each correct answer yields one point. 
 If I'm not mistaken, in this case I have  $n!(/n-r)!=60$  possible answer combinations, but I don't know what formula I use to calculate the probability of randomly hitting a combination with  $0, 1, 2$  or  $3$  correct answers. As far as I can see, this is a draw without replacement where the order matters, so I can neither treat it like a dice problem (e.g. ""How likely are exactly three sixes in ten throws?"" - binomial distribution) nor like a control sample (""How likely is it that exactly  $5$  of these  $100$  screws are defective?"" - hypergeometric distribution), because then either the non-replacement or the order is not taken into account. 
 I wrote down all  $60$  possible permutations and added up how many points each of them would yield. If I counted correctly, there ... 
 -... is one possible permutation that yields all three points, 
 -... are  $6$  permutations that yield 2 points, 
 -... are  $21$  permutations that yield 1 point, 
 -... are  $32$  permutations that yield 0 points.

"Someone once briefly explained to me why it is that chocolate chip cookies have 37% chocolate in them. To the best of my memory it has to do with the way trying to place dots in a circle in a random and scattered way behave, which turns out to be  $1/e$  or  $\approx37%$ . 
 
 There are 2 levels of validating this: 
 
 The first is the theoretical side: Can you find a suitable definition for ""random and scattered"" in a circle that fits the use case and the  $1/e$  behavior? 
 
 The second level is the practical. How does the size of the dots and volume impact this phenomenon? Are there real-life constraints that force it to be  $1/e$ ? 
 
 
 Edit 
 http://sarcasticresonance.wordpress.com/2012/03/11/1e-do-not-lie/ 
This blogger validated the fact these do have 37% chocolate, and after contacting him he provided me with the following partial explanation, yet for this to become a full answer some conversion of the problem is needed and practical considerations to be taken. 
 Let us assume the following: 
 In the factory the manufacturing process start with a chunk of chocolate the size of a cookie, which is made up from a million chocolate particles.
After that there are a million robotic arms.
Each arm chooses a chocolate particle randomly and replaces it with cookie dough, unfortunately there is no synchronization between the arms, and its possible for few arm to switch the same chocolate particle.
Its obvious that not all million of the particles will be switched but less, and therefore we will have some mix, the question is what will the ratio be. 
 Let us look on a specific particle, what is the probability of it being switched?
hard to calculate directly since it may be chosen by some or all arms, but can be calculated throw elimination: an arm doesn't choose it if it happens to choose another particle. 
 That means: 
 $(N-1)/N = 1 - 1/N$ 
 Is sum of all articles so the probability of  no  arm choosing it is N when: 
 $(1-1/N)^N$ 
 And that makes the probability of an arm to  do  choose any particle: 
 $1 - (1-1/N)^N$ 
 Well approach n to infinity, well use the know fact: 
 $(1-1/N)^N ----> 1/e$ 
 We will get that in average: 
 $1-1/e = 0.63$ 
 Which means 0.63 of the chocolate is being switch and there for 37% chocolate is left. 
 The question remains on the following points: 
 
 Can this be converted to scattering things in a circle? [this will make the next part easier] 
 
 Does this fit to real life constraints? or is it not?

 As requested and in reponse to the claim that 37% refers to the chocolate itself, iv'e added a picture of the back with the ingridients

 Solve $z^3 + z_1=z_2$ with $z_1=(-2+i)^3$ and $z_2=\frac{1+28i}{2+i}$. 
 Show the answer in trigonometric form. 
 
 Given enough time I could solve this through trial and error, but that's exactly the problem. It takes me too long to solve this. Here are my main issues with this kind of exercises: 
 
 To put the numbers in the trig form I do the following with z = x+yi: 
 
 Calculate $\rho$: $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ 
 Then I try to calculate $\theta$ as follows: $x = \rho\cdot\cos(\theta) \land y = \rho\cdot \sin(\theta)$ 
 
 
 The problem with this is that I am not allowed to use the calculator so sometimes $\theta$ is some value that is not as easy as  these . 
 The way this kind of exercise goes is that you either have to put everything in the trig form and then do the operations, or you have to simplify everything, then put in trig form, then do the operations, or you have to simplify everything, do all operations and finally put the answer in trig form. 
 But I never know for sure which way to do this and more often than not I get into a dead end and can't put it in trig form because of the reason I mentioned above, and have to do go back. But go back to which step? That's another issue. 
 Anyone know how to solve this quickly? Do you have any tricks you can teach me?

 $a_1 = 3.(2) + 0 - 5.(\delta_{n,1}) = 1$

 $$a_n = 3a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + 2\delta_{n,0} - 5\delta_{n,1}$$ 
 Multiplying by  $x^n$ : 
 $$a_n . x^n = 3a_{n-1} . x^n + a_{n-2} . x^n + 2\delta_{n,0} . x^n - 5\delta_{n,1} . x^n$$ 
 Summing up both sides: 
 $$\sum_{n\geq0} a_n . x^n = \sum_{n\geq0}3a_{n-1} . x^n + \sum_{n\geq0}a_{n-2} . x^n + \sum_{n\geq0}2\delta_{n,0} . x^n - \sum_{n\geq0}5\delta_{n,1} . x^n$$

"Here's a problem that has had me scratching my head for a long time: 
 Imagine you're in a game show, and are presented with 2 boxes.  You are told that both boxes contain a sum of cash, but one of the boxes contains twice as much as the other.  You do not know which box has the double prize.  The game works in 2 phases: 
 
 Choose any of the boxes you want. 
 Look inside the box.  At this point you can decide to keep the contents, or switch to the other box. 
 
 So imagine that you've chosen a box, and it contains \$100.  From here, you can calculate the ""expected value"" of the other box to be $0.5 \times \$50 + 0.5 \times \$200 = \$125$ and therefore decide to switch. 
 But then it follows that you would have made the same decision for any value $x$ that you would have found in the first box!  So then why not just pick the other box in the first place? 
 In other words, the strategy of ""pick a box at random, and then switch, no matter what"" is equivalent to ""pick a candidate box at random, and then pick the other box, and keep it"", which is also equivalent to ""pick a box at random, and keep it"".  Which means that switching is the same as not switching. 
 But this seems like a paradox, because we just calculated that switching the box after your initial choice increases your expected winnings by a factor of 1.25!

"Full question below: 
 You are the manager of the customer support division in your company. Your
division uses 3 telephone lines operated by 3 separate customer service representatives. A
customer is put on hold if their call arrives while all 3 customer service representatives are
busy serving other customers. You observe that customer calls arrive at a Poisson rate of 5
per hour, and that the length of the customer calls is exponentially distributed. You also
observe that 75% of the time, a customer is not put on hold, while the remaining 25% of
the time, a customer can expected to be put on hold for an average of 12 minutes. You wish
to improve service in the division by making sure that 90% of the time, a customer is not
put on hold, while 10% of the time, a customer can expect to be put on hold for an average
of only 4 minutes. How many telephone lines will you add to your division to achieve your
goal? 
 
 So I think the biggest problem here is that I don't know $\mu$.  I do know $\rho=\frac{\lambda}{c\mu}=\frac{5}{3\mu}$ for this problem.  I understand that ""time on hold"" refers to to time waiting in the queue.  With $W$ is time waiting in the queue, I know:
$$E[W]=\frac{\rho}{\lambda(1-\rho)}P(W>0)$$ 
 With 3 operators, I used the fact that ""75% of the time, a customer is not put on hold, while the remaining 25% of
the time, a customer can expected to be put on hold for an average of 12 minutes"" to calculate:
$$E[W]=.75(0) + .25(12min)=3min$$
Then using $E[W]$ along with $P(W>0)=.25$, I solved the first equation to find $\mu=\frac{10}{3}$.  
 Knowing $u$, I used ""90% of the time, a customer is not
put on hold, while 10% of the time, a customer can expect to be put on hold for an average
of only 4 minutes"" to find the new $E[W]=1min$ and $P(W>0)=.1$.   
 To solve for $c$(number of servers) I again plugged these numbers into the original equation for $E[W]$ and found $c=3.3$. You can obviously only have an integer number of servers, so this would be $c=4$, and minus the original 3 would give the addition of just 1 server as the answer. 
 Sorry for the long question, but am I doing this right?  I feel like I messed up along the way or made some wrong assumptions (mostly that $E[W] can be calculated from the information in the problem).

"I am analyzing the following system, where  $I_{in}$  is a scalar parameter:

&\dot{R} = 0.8 \left( -R +1.25V + 1.5 \right)
\end{aligned}
$$ 
 It is a simplified version of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations for neuronal excitability (reference to book below). 
 There is a single equilibrium, that varies with  $I_{in}$ , so we need to calculate the Jacobian at those equilibrium values and perform a stability analysis. Such an analysis reveals that as  $I_{in}$  increases from zero to around 1.5, the system undergoes a supercritical Hopf bifurcation [ edit : it undergoes what I intuitively thought was a supercritical bifurcation]: 
 
 We go from a stable center to an unstable center at a critical value (zero real eigenvalue) at  $I_{crit}=0.966064$ . Note that I calculated the limit cycle boundaries in that diagram by just getting the minimum and maximum values of  V  for each loop through the limit cycle (examples of such loops are shown below in Figures 3 and 4). 
 ( Edit : I added my derivation of  $I_{crit}$  below). 
 You can see the nature of the transition in the trace-determinant diagram in the following Figure 2: 
 
 As  $I_{in}$  increases, the equilibrium point turns from a sink to a (stable) spiral, and then we hit the critical point at  $I_{crit}$ , after which we have a spiral source surrounded by a (stable) limit cycle, and eventually a stable source also surrounded by a limit cycle. 
 So far, so good, I think. This all seems pretty straightforward. 
 So what is the problem? At this point I am confused about a couple of things. In my book it says the following two facts (corollaries of the Hopf Bifurcation theorem) should be true near  $I_{crit}$ : 
 
 The amplitude of oscillations will be very small. 
 The frequency of oscillation should be close to  $\omega/2\pi$  Hz, where  $\omega$  is the imaginary part of the eigenvalue. 
 
 It seems that neither of these facts is true here. 
 First, the oscillation amplitude starts out very large, as you can see in the bifurcation diagram in Figure 1. There is none of that textbook ramping up of the amplitude. 
 Indeed, even when  $I_{in}$  is  less  than  $I_{crit}$ , there already a large, stable, limit-cycle-like orbit in this phase space! The following figure shows some full orbits in the phase space (left), and a couple of V trajectories on the right. This is for  $I_{in}=I_{crit}-0.00874$ : 
 
 That is, we have lots of large-amplitude stable orbits cycling around some stable centers (such damped oscillations occur only for orbits that are close to the equilibrium point). So not only does the limit cycle start out with a large amplitude past  $I_{crit}$ , it seems there is already a kind of harbinger of a limit cycle with a large amplitude even  before  the bifurcation. 
 That said, the above two facts do seem to apply to the damped spirals in Figure 2: the amplitude of the spiral is very small (tending toward zero), and its frequency is basically exactly  $\omega/2\pi$   -- it is basically double the frequency of the large-amplitude pseudo-limit cycle that encloses it. Could that be what my text is referring to? 
 This brings me explicitly to the second fact above: at  $I_{crit}$  the eigenvalues are  $\pm 3.05i$ . Hence, the frequency of oscillation should be about 0.5 Hz, a period of 2 s. But instead I see a period of 4 seconds (0.25 Hz), as the following diagram of V versus time for  $I=I_{crit}+0.000001$  shows: 
 
 I calculate the period based on the distance between the red X's. I'll mention again, though, if we were to do the same analysis of the oscillations of the damped spirals (as in Figure 3) the frequencies of those damped oscillations  would  basically be right -- it is the full limit cycles that seem off (though their order of magnitude is right). 
 Overall, this system is supposed to be approachable because of its  simplicity  but I've already spent about a week hitting my head against it, still not sure of some of the most basic facts about Hopf Bifurcations. 
 Derivation of the critical value 
 Note the Jacobian of the system is:
 $$
J = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial V} & \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial R}\\
\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial V} & \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial R}
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
10(1-V^2) & -10 \\
1 & -0.8
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 
Our task is essentially to determine the system's (V,R) equilibria for different values of  $I_{in}$ . Then, we can plug these equilibrium values into the Jacobian for our stability analysis, and find the coefficient matrix where the real part of the eigenvalues go to zero. 
 How do we find this? First, I found the equilibrium value of V that would yield purely imaginary eigenvalues, and I did this using the trace. That is, the sum of the eigenvalues is the same as the sum of the values in the coefficient matrix (the trace). From the equation for the Jacobian above, we know the trace is zero when: 
 $$
9.2 - 10V^2 = 0 \implies V = \pm \sqrt{0.92} = \pm 0.959
$$ 
 Focusing on the negative root for now, this implies that our critical value of  $I_{in}$  will be the one that generates  $V_{eqm}=-0.959$ . 
 How do we find this value of  $I_{in}$ ? I did it by substitution, using the nullcline equations of our system. Namely, the equations for the nullclines of our system are given by: 
 $$
\begin{aligned}
&R = V - \frac{V^3}{3} + I_{input}\\
&R = 1.25V + 1.5
\end{aligned}
$$ 
 So, if given a value  $V_{eqm}$  we can plug the second nullcline equation  $R(V)$  into the first, and solve for  $I_{in}$  in terms of  $V$ . Namely, given a value of  $V_{eqm}$ , the  $I_{in}$  that produces that will be: 
 $$
I_{in}=\frac{V^3}{3} + 0.25V + 1.5
$$ 
 So, looping back to our question, if we plug in  $V_{eqm}=-0.959$  into this equation, that yields  $I_{crit}=0.966$ . Note also that plugging this  $I_{crit}$  into the original system of equations and numerically solving for the equilibrium using Python's  fsolve()  yields the equilibrium point  (V, R) = (-0.959, 0.301) , which gives secondary confirmation of our result. 
 The Jacobian at this equilibrium point is: 
 $$
J = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.8 & -10 \\
1 & -0.8
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 
 This coefficient matrix has purely imaginary eigenvalues  $\pm3.06i$ , as expected. So it seems we have a critical value where the real part of the eigenvalues reaches zero, as originally claimed. QED, maybe? 
 To address a question from a comment: when  $I=0.866$  the equilibrum point is  $(V, R) = (-1.04, 0.20)$ , and the eigenvalues of the Jacobian are  $-0.8\pm3.16i$ . This, coupled with the secondary confirmation of the calculations from the trace-discriminant curve (Figure 2 above), make me think there isn't a mistake in the calculation of  $I_{crit}$  above. That said, I have definitely made worse mistakes in my lifetime, and thought I was right, so we definitely shouldn't exclude this possibility.

"I have to find the asymptotic curves of the surface given by $$z = a \left( \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x} \right),$$ for constant $a \neq 0$. 
 I guess that what was meant by that statement is that surface $S$ can be locally parametrized by $$X(u,v) = \left( u, v, a \left( \frac{u}{v} + \frac{u}{v} \right) \right).$$  Do you think that my parametrization is correct (meaning that I read the description of the surface correctly), and do you know of a more convenient parametrization? 
 Assuming that parametrization, I derived the following ($E$, $F$, $G$, are the coefficients of the first fundamental form; $e$, $f$, $g$ are coefficients of the second fundamental form; $N$ is the normal vector to surface $S$ at a point; these quantities are all functions of local coordinates $(u,v)$): 
 $$E = 1 + a^2 \left( \frac{1}{v} - \frac{v}{u^2} \right)^2,$$ 
$$F = -\frac{a^2 (u^2 - v^2)^2}{u^3 v^3},$$
$$G = 1 + a^2 \left( \frac{1}{u} - \frac{u}{v^2} \right)^2.$$ 
 $$N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{E G - F^2}} \left( a \left( \frac{v}{u^2}-\frac{1}{v} \right), a \left( \frac{u}{v^2}-\frac{1}{u} \right), 1 \right).$$ 
 $$X_{u,u} = \left( 0,0, \frac{2 a v}{u^3} \right), X_{u,v} = \left( 0,0, -a \left( \frac{1}{u^2} + \frac{1}{v^2} \right) \right), X_{v,v} = \left( 0, 0, \frac{2 a u}{v^3} \right).$$ 
 $$e = \frac{2 a v}{u^3 \sqrt{E G - F^2}},$$
$$f = - \frac{a (\frac{1}{u^2} + \frac{1}{v^2})}{\sqrt{E G - F^2}},$$
$$g = \frac{2 a u}{v3 \sqrt{E G - F^2}}.$$ 
 Thus, the Gaussian curvature (from these calculations) is:
$$K = -\frac{a^2 u^4 v^4 (u^2 - v^2)^2}{(u^4 v^4 + 
  a^2 (u^2 - v^2)^2 (u^2 + v^2))^2}.$$ 
 And the mean curvature would be:
$$H = \frac{a u^3 v^3 (u^4 + v^4)}{(u^4 v^4 + a^2 (u^2 - v^2)^2 (u^2 + v^2))^{3/2
 }}.$$ 
 So, the principal curvatures are:
$$k_{\pm} = H \pm \sqrt{H^2 - K} = a u^2 v^2 \frac{u v (u^4 + v^4) \pm \sqrt{(u^2 + v^2) (a^2 (u^2 - v^2)^4 + u^2 v^2 (u^6 + v^6))}}{(u^4 v^4 + a^2 (u^2 - v^2)^2 (u^2 + v^2))^{3/2}}.$$ 
 In order to find the asymptotic curves, but trying to avoid the differential equation, I was hoping to find the angles $\theta (u,v)$ such that the normal curvature would always be $0$.  In other words I was trying:
$0 = k_n = k_{+} \cos{(\theta)}^2 + k_{-} \sin{(\theta)}^2$, and solving for $\theta$. 
 Assuming sufficient niceness, this calculate would result in: $$(u v (u^4 + v^4) + \sqrt{(u^2 + v^2) (a^2 (u^2 - v^2)^4 + u^2 v^2 (u^6 + v^6))}) \cos{(\theta)}^2 + (u v (u^4 + v^4) - \sqrt{(u^2 + v^2) (a^2 (u^2 - v^2)^4 + u^2 v^2 (u^6 + v^6))}) \sin{(\theta)}^2$$ 
 First of all, is this approach (solving for $\theta$ rather than solving the differential equation) valid? If it is, after I find that angle $\theta$, determined by location $(u,v)$ on $S$, what more work do I have to do? How do I find the equations for the asymptotic curves based on this angle? 
 If this whole method was for naught, how does one solve the differential equation. in this case, of: $$e (u')^2 + 2f u' v' + g (v')^2 = 2a v^4 (u')^2 - 2a u^3 v^3 \left( \frac{1}{u^2} + \frac{1}{v^2} \right)u' v' + 2a u^4 (v')^2 = 0?$$ (Again, assuming sufficient niceness.)

a)  I can also understand “Derivative” is nothing but Rate of change of one quantity over another(at a given point).
b)  Partial derivative is Rate of change of one quantity over another, irrespective of another quantity , if more than two factors are in equation. 
 The point that I canNOT relate or understand clearly is,
a)  why should we use derivative in neural network, how exactly does it help
b)  Why should we activation function, in most cases its Sigmoid function.
c)  I could not get a complete picture of how derivatives helps neural network.

 There are $28$ students in a class, $15$ study chemistry, $18$ study physics and $2$ study neither chemistry nor physics. 
 
 Calculate the probability that a student chosen at random studies both chemistry and physics. 
 My approach was as follows: 
 We pick a random person, the chance that this person studies physics is $\frac{18}{28}$ (because $18$ people study physics out a total of $28$). Now given that he studies physics, what is the chance that he also studies chemistry? I would say $P(\text{chem}|\text{phy}) = \frac{15}{26}$, because we already now that the person studies physics we can exclude the two persons who study neither given $26$ in total, of which $15$ study physics. Concluding that:
$P(\text{phy and chem}) = P(\text{phy})P(\text{chem}|\text{phy}) = \frac{18}{28}\frac{15}{26} = 0.37$. 
 However, the solutions provides elsewjere stated the following approach: 
 $P(\text{phy and chem}) = P(\text{phy}) + P(\text{chem}) - P(\text{phy}\cup \text{chem})$.

Concluding that: $P(\text{phy and chem}) = \frac{18}{28}+\frac{15}{28} - \frac{26}{28} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.

"From the figure shown:  $ M $  and  $ N $  are tangency points,  $ O $  and  $ E $  are centers, and  $ r = 2 $ . Calculate Triangular Region Area  $ MNE $ 
 
 Attemp:  The area is  $2$ . First and foremost I shall use the double angle formula for  $\tan x$  which says  $\tan{\frac{x}{2}}=\frac{\sin x}{1+\cos x}$ . Applying it to  $x=45^{\circ}$  we have  $\tan 22.5^{\circ}=\sqrt{2}-1.$  Since  $\text{NOV}\Delta \sim \text{MAO}\Delta$  thus  $\frac{\text{NV}}{2}=\tan{22.5^{\circ}}=\sqrt{2}-1$  consequently  $\text{NV}=2(\sqrt{2}-1).$   $\text{UV}=2+\text{NV}=2\sqrt{2}.$  In the next step we work out  $R$ . Since  $\text{AWE}\Delta \sim \text{AUV}\Delta$  hence  $\frac{\text{WE}}{\text{UV}}=\frac{\text{AW}}{AU}$  and it implies  $\frac{R}{2\sqrt{2}}=\frac{2\sqrt{2}+4+R}{2\sqrt{2}+4}$  where from we have  $R=2(\sqrt{2}+1).$   $PQ=2+\sqrt{2}$  and it gives  $\text{EP}=\text{EQ}-\text{PQ}=\sqrt{2}$  furthermore  $\text{MN}=2\sqrt{2}.$  From these we have $$\text{Area=}\frac{1}{2}\cdot\text{MN}\cdot\text{EP}=\frac{1}{2}\cdot2\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{2}=2. $$

"The entropy (self information) of a  discrete  random variable X is calculated as: 
 $$
H(x)=E(-\log[P(X)])
$$ 
 What does the  $-\log[P(X)]$  mean? It seems to be something like """" the self information of each possible outcome of the random variable X "". 
 And why do we use  log  function to calculate it? 
 ADD 1 
 Well, below is my reasoning: 
 The root motivation is to quantify/measure the uncertainty contained in a random variable. 
 Intuitively , people tend to agree that there's  some connection between uncertainty and probability . And still  intuitively , people shall agree that: 
 
 the more probability an outcome has, the less uncertainty it has. 
 thus , the less probability an outcome has, the more uncertainty it has. 
 
 So, I think if we want to measure the uncertainty for an outcome of a random variable, the measure function should satisfy: 
 
 the value of uncertainty measure should be positive ( human instinct when counting ) 
 the value of this measure for the uncertainty of an outcome should be monotonic decreasing function of the probability of that outcome. 
 for outcomes of independent experiments, the uncertainty should be additive. That is for P(A)*P(B), the total uncertainty should be the sum of A's and B's. ( This is kind of instinctive, too. ) 
 
 Then I come to the choice of -log[p(i)] as the measure of uncertainty  of each possible outcome , or self-information of each outcome. 
 Then I treat the entropy as the weighted average of the self-information of all possible outcomes. 
 I just read the book < Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms > by MacKay. The author indeed gives a similar explanation to mine. And he name it the  information content of each outcome . It is not difficult to see that  entropy better describes a random variable than the information content . 
 And it is  coincidental  that the formula we  intuitively  found to measure the average information content of a random variable has  a similar form to the one of entropy in thermodynamics . Thus comes the name  information entropy ... 
 BTW I want to quote some words from Einstein... 
 
 ""It is not so important where one settles down. The best thing is to
follow your instincts without too much reflection."" 
 --Einstein to Max Born, March 3, 1920. AEA 8-146 
 
 ADD 2 
 Following my above reasoning, I tried to derive the calculation of entropy for a  continuous  random variable Y in a  similar  way.  But I was blocked . Details below. 
 Let Y's p.d.f be:  $$f(y)$$ 
 Then, if we  strictly  follow my previous reasoning, then we should pick up a small interval of  I , and the  probability  of Y within interval I is given by:  $$P(y\ within\ I)=\int_If(y)dy$$ Then the measure of uncertainty for Y to fall in interval I should be:  $$m(y\ within\ I) = -log\int_If(y)dy$$  Then, to get the entropy, we should get the expectation/average of  this measure m , which is essentially:  $$E[m(y\ within\ I)]$$  and it can be expanded as below: 
 $$
\int{P(y\ within\ I)*m(y\ within\ I)}dI
=\int{(\int_I{f(y)dy}*{(-log\int_If(y)dy)})dI}
$$ 
 I found myself stuck here because the interval I is not strictly defined. 
 Then I find from  here  the authoritative definition of entropy of continuous random variable: 
 $$
H(Y)=-\int{f(y)log[f(y)]dy}
$$ 
 The p.d.f.  $f(y)$  can certainly be  $> 1$ , so the  $H(Y)$  can be  negative , while in discrete scenario, the  $H(X)$  is always  non-negative . 
 I cannot explain the why this in-consistence is happening. For now, I can only consider it as a  philosophical difficulty regarding continuity and discreteness . 
 Some of my personal feeling (can be safely ignored): 
 
 In the discrete scenario, the  concrete countable  outcome provide the
 foothold  for us to carry out our calculation. But in the continuous
scenario, there's no such ready-made foothold (unless we can somehow
make one). Without such foothold, it feels like we just keep falling
into the endless hollowness of mind. 
 
 Anyone could shed some light?

 $e$ is given by the unusual limit $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\left(\frac{(n + 1)^{n + 1}}{n^{n}} - \frac{n^{n}}{(n - 1)^{n - 1}}\right) = e\tag{1}$$ Now if we put $$a_{n} = \frac{(n + 1)^{n + 1}}{n^{n}}$$ then the above result says that $$\lim_{n \to \infty}(a_{n} - a_{n - 1}) = e$$ Now we know that 
 Theorem: If $a_{n} - a_{n - 1} \to L$ then $a_{n}/n \to L$ . 
 Using the example here we see that $$\frac{a_{n}}{n} = \frac{n + 1}{n}\left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^{n} \to e$$ I am thinking of some partial converse to the standard theorem above which can get us from limit of $a_{n}/n$ to limit of $a_{n} - a_{n - 1}$. 
 Another option to prove $(1)$ is to make use of real variable theory. Thus we can put $x = 1/n$ and deal with function $f(x) = \left(1 + \dfrac{1}{x}\right)(1 + x)^{1/x}$ and use Taylor expansion $$(1 + x)^{1/x} = e - \frac{ex}{2} + \frac{11e}{24}x^{2} + \cdots$$ and $$g(x) = \left(\frac{1}{x} - 1\right)(1 - x)^{-1/x}$$ and calculate the limit of $f(x) - g(x)$ as $x \to 0$. This way we see that $$f(x) = \frac{e}{2} + \frac{e}{x} + o(1), g(x) = -\frac{e}{2} + \frac{e}{x} + o(1)$$ and clearly $f(x) - g(x) \to e$ as $x \to 0$.

 The question is, what happens when in a cycle there are multiple orbits? 
 From Wikipedia: ""The length of a cycle is the number of elements of its largest orbit."". 
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_permutation 
 Some examples: 
 
 $\displaystyle ( 123)( 31) ,$  max  $\displaystyle k=3$ ,  $\displaystyle ( -1)^{3-1} =1$ . On the other hand, I know this cycle has sign  $\displaystyle -1$ .

 Also, I know that each cycle can be written as an aggregiation of transformation (ie:  $\displaystyle ( p_{0} p_{1} \dotsc p_{k}) =( p_{0} p_{1}) \cdotp ( p_{1} p_{2}) \cdotp \dotsc \cdotp ( p_{k-1} p_{k})$ .

 In example 2 they were disjoint and still didn't work 
 
 And if so, then how can you quickly calculate the sign of not disjoint cycles? (without having to unroll them). 
 
 
 Bottom line, could anyway clarify how to calculate the sign of cycles with multiple orbits? Both for joints and disjoint ones.

 Let $K : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 1$ and $P = (a,b,c)$ be a point on the
  border of of K (i.e $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1)$.  
 Determine the volume of the body of all points within $K$ with a
  maximum distance of $\sqrt{2}$ to the point P. 
 
 I know I can solve this by using a triple integral to calculate the volume between the sphere centered at $(0,0,1)$ with radius $\sqrt{2}$ and the sphere $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 1$. 
 However, I initially used a different method and I'm wondering why it's wrong. Here is  my attempt :  
 The point $(x,y,z)$ must satisfy: 
$$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 1$$
$$(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 \leq 2$$
The last condition is equivalent to: 
$$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 -2ax - 2by - 2cz + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 2$$
Since $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$, we get: 
$$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 -2(ax+by+cz) \leq 1 $$
Now, the tangent plane to the sphere in point P is equivalent to $ax+by+cz = C$ where $C$ is a constant. Since $(a,b,c)$ must satisfy the equation of the tangent plane we get that $C=1$. Substituting this into the above equation I get: 
$$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 3$$
This is obviously wrong since this volume is larger than the initial sphere. 
 What have I actually calculated? Why is my method wrong?

"Question: 
 Let $f$ be the function : 
 $$f(z) = \bigg(\frac{z}{z+1}\bigg)^2 = \bigg(1-\frac{1}{1+z}\bigg)^2 = 1 -2\frac{1}{1+z} + \frac{1}{(1+z)^2}$$ 
 Find the  Taylor  expansion of the function $f$ around $i$ and also the convergence radius. 
 Attempt: 
 From the  Cauchy-Taylor  theorem : 
 $$f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(z-i)^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(i)}{n!}(z-i)^n,|z-i|<R $$ 
 We have to calculate the $a_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(i)}{n!}, \forall n\in \mathbb N$ and the radius of convergence $R$.  
 Now, in similar exercises, all fraction function could be manipulated to give you such a form around the expansion point, that could be used to be set as $w$, in order to use one of the known geometric series : 
 $$\frac{1}{1-w} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}w^n ,|w|<1$$
$$\frac{1}{1+w} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^nw^n,|w|<1$$ 
 And after having such an expression, by differentiating the geometric series, you'd be getting the final expression of the   Taylor Expansion , since the function has one and only series expansion. Finally, to get the convergence radiues, you would just solve the expression $|w|<1$, where $w$ would be a fraction-function of $z-i$.  
 My problem with the particular example is that I cannot seem to find a way (or my head is stuck) to make such an expression, thus I cannot continue with the steps I've mentioned. 
 I'd appreciate a thorough help/solution or any advice and tips on such problems, because it's a new subject I'm working on, on our Complex Analysis Semester.

"I recently took a better look at the  operator norm  defined on a matrix $\mathbf A \in \Bbb{K}^{n\times n}$ as follows: 
 $$
\|\mathbf A\|_p=\sup\{\|\mathbf Ax\|_p \mid x\in\Bbb{K}^n\land\|x\|=1\}
$$ 
 The first time I looked at this I thought ""ok, lets calculate it for a few example matrices"". I started with $n = 3$ and $p = 2$, just to start ""simple"". Let
$$
\mathbf A = \left[\begin{matrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\end{matrix}\right]\quad a_{ij}\in\Bbb{K}^n
$$
Now if we're going to minimize $\|\mathbf Ax\|_2$ ($ = \|\mathbf Ax\|$), we might as well make it easy on ourselves and only minimize $\|\mathbf Ax\|^2$ so as to not worry about that annoying radical. We get
$$
\begin{align}
\|\mathbf Ax\|^2 & = (a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3)^2 + (a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3)^2 + (a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3)^2 \\
& = Ax_1^2 + Bx_2^2 + Cx_3^2 + Dx_1x_2 + Ex_1x_3 + Fx_2x_3
\end{align}
$$
where
$$
\begin{align}
A & = a_{11}^2+a_{21}^2+a_{31}^2 \\
B & = a_{12}^2+a_{22}^2+a_{32}^2 \\
C & = a_{13}^2+a_{23}^2+a_{33}^2 \\
D & = 2(a_{11}a_{12} + a_{21}a_{22} + a_{31}a_{33}) \\
E & = 2(a_{11}a_{13} + a_{21}a_{23} + a_{31}a_{33}) \\
F & = 2(a_{12}a_{13} + a_{22}a_{23} + a_{32}a_{33})
\end{align}
$$
Now lets define 
$$
G(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3) = Ax_1^2+Bx_2^2+Cx_3^2+Dx_1x_2+Ex_1x_3+Fx_2x_3
$$
So if we want to minimize $||\mathbf Ax||^2$, we're either going to have to minimize
$$
N(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3) = \frac{G(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3)}{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2}
$$
or simply minimize $G$ with the constraint $g(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = 1$. The latter seemed easier to me, so I gave it a shot using Lagrange multipliers. 
 As usual, I defined 
$$
\mathcal{L}(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3,\ \lambda) = G(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3)-\lambda g(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3)
$$
setting it's gradient to zero gives
$$
\nabla \mathcal L = 0 \implies \begin{cases}
2(A - \lambda)x_1 + Dx_2 + Ex_3 & = 0 \\
Dx_1 + 2(B - \lambda)x_2 + Fx_3 & = 0 \\
Ex_1 + Fx_2 + 2(C - \lambda)x_3 & = 0 \\
x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - 1 & = 0
\end{cases}
$$
Now this is where I really started to get stuck. I tried solving the first three equations for $x_1,\ x_2,$ and $x_3$ but didn't end up with anything I could use. I tried solving for $x_1$ in terms of $x_2,\ x_3,$ and $\lambda$, then $x_2$ in terms of $x_3$ and $\lambda$, and then subbing that all into the third equation, but ended up with either $x_3 = 0$ or 
$$
4\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2(A+B+C) + \lambda(4AB+4AC+4BC-D2+E^2+F^2)-4ABC-AF^2-BE^2+CD^2+DEF = 0
$$
which, although technically solvable for $\lambda$ via the cubic equation, would be incredibly messy. 
 Now, I probably created my own roadblock for this problem, because I didn't want to think about the system of equations logically and just wanted to bash it out. Regardless of my approach, it seems like the operator norm is a very difficult thing to calculate, and I only analyzed the case where $n = 3$ and $p = 2$. What about the general case? What if $n = 75$ and $p = 9/4$? How on earth would you calculate it then? 
 The questions above are rhetorical, however, and my actual question is as follows: 
 
 Why define such an ordinary norm for matrices which is so difficult to calculate in general? 
 
 I see the operator norm everywhere, and it seems like the standard norm for a lot of theorems (unless I'm mistaken and ||A|| just means  any  matrix norm). So why would we define such a standard norm in a way that is so difficult to calculate? What's the point? Is it easy to work with in theorems? I get that it intuitively makes sense as a norm, but it can't possibly be that easy to work with, especially in comparison to things like the Frobenius norm.  
 So why do we care about this definition?

"I am supposed, in an  exercise, to calculate the above integral by integrating $f(z) = e^{-z^{2}}$ on the following countor:  
 I began by separating the path $\gamma$ into three paths (obvious from the picture), and parametrizing each as follows: 
 $\gamma_{1} : [0, R] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ with $\gamma_{1}(t) = t$ 
 $\gamma_{2} : [0, \frac{\pi}{4}] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ with $\gamma_{2}(t) = Re^{it}$ 
 $\gamma_{3} : [0, \frac{\sqrt{2}R}{2}] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ with $\gamma_{3}^{-}(t) = t + it$ (with reverse orientation). 
 Then we can say that $\displaystyle\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \displaystyle\int_{\gamma_{1}} f(z) dz + \displaystyle\int_{\gamma_{2}} f(z) dz - \displaystyle\int_{\gamma_{3}^{-}} f(z) dz = 0$ since the path is closed. 
 Now $\displaystyle\int_{\gamma_{1}} f(z) dz = \displaystyle\int\limits_{0}^{R} e^{-t^{2}} dt$. We also get $\displaystyle\int_{\gamma_{3}^{-}} f(z) dz = -(i + 1) \displaystyle\int\limits_{0}^{\frac{\sqrt{2}R}{2}}e^{-2it^{2}} dt$. After playing around with sine and cosine a bunch to evaluate that last integral, I get: 
 $$0 = \int\limits_{0}^{R} e^{-t^{2}} dt + \int\limits_{\gamma_{2}} f(z) dz - \frac{i + 1}{\sqrt{2}} \int\limits_{0}^{R} \cos(u^{2}) du + \frac{i - 1}{\sqrt{2}} \int\limits_{0}^{R} \sin(u^{2}) du$$ 
 I could not evaluate the integral along the second path, but I thought it might tend to 0 as $R \rightarrow \infty$. Then taking limits and equating real parts we get 
 $$\frac{\sqrt{2 \pi}}{2} = \displaystyle\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \sin(u^{2}) du + \displaystyle\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \cos(u^{2}) du$$

"In an  answer  to the question  Fastest way to calculate $e^x$ upto arbitrary number of decimals?  there is a description of a method by which the number of terms needed to calcluate $e^x$ to a given precision can be halved: 
 
 Although the exponential function is not even (or odd), it satisfies a
  relation:      $$e^{-x} = 1/e^x$$    that implies it is a simple
  rational transformation of an even function: 
 $$e^x = (1 + x*f(x^2))/(1 - x*f(x^2))$$    which may be solved for a
  power series or continued fraction approximation of f(z).  This is the
  idea of  symmetry  as it applies to the exponential function.  Not
  only does it reduce the evaluaton of the exponential function on the
  whole real line to just the positive (or the negative) half, it also
  ""contracts"" the number of terms needed for a given accuracy by half
  (retaining only $x^2$ terms in the expansion). 
 
 Unfortunately, I am not able to understand how to 'solve for the power series approximation of f(z)'. 
 The context is that I am trying to improve the performance of code that calclulates $e^x$ to arbitrary precision.

However, despite finishing that course and passing the exam, I feel that I'm still missing the most important thing to know -  when  to use it. After the calculus class came a physics class, and whenever the lecturer told us that a problem is best solved by applying an integral, I simply took his word for it, being unable to understand why this was. 
 What I'm interested is  not  examples of common uses of calculus (I can easily find plenty with a simple web search). Rather, what I would like to know is how to tell if a solving a particular problem will require using calculus, when it isn't one of the commonplace scenarios that I brought up in the first paragraph.

"How do I calculate a basis for  $\ker (\varphi)$  and  $\operatorname{im}(\varphi)$ ? 
 Where, given 
 $$ A = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & -1\\
-1 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}$$ 
we define 
 $$ \begin{matrix}
\varphi: \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2} \to \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2} \\
X \mapsto XA+A^t X^t
\end{matrix}$$ 
 Let  $B$  be the standard basis for  $\mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$  : 
 $$B =\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0\\
0 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 1\\
0 & 0\\ 
\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 0\\
1 & 0\\ 
\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 0\\
0 & 1\\ 
\end{pmatrix} \right\}$$ 
 Calculate  $\textsf{M}_B(\varphi)$  we come to  $$\textsf{M}_B(\varphi) = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
-1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & 1 & -1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\end{pmatrix}$$ 
 We calculate a basis for the kernel like this:
If  
 $$X:= \begin{pmatrix} 
a & b\\
c & d\\ 
\end{pmatrix}$$ 
 then  $$\varphi(X) = \begin{pmatrix} 
a-b & -a+b\\
c-d & -c+d\\ 
\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} 
a-b & c-d\\
-a+b & -c+d\\ 
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
2a-2b & -a+b+c-d\\
c-d-a+b & -2c+2d\\ 
\end{pmatrix}$$ 
 Now we have to look, for what values  $$\begin{pmatrix} 
2a-2b & -a+b+c-d\\
c-d-a+b & -2c+2d\\ 
\end{pmatrix}$$ 
by definition, the kernel of a linear transformation is  $\varphi(X) = 0$ , therefore our basis for  $\ker(\varphi)$  should be 
 $$\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0  \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1  \end{pmatrix} \right\}$$ 
 Now here comes the part where I'm confused. How do I calculate a basis for  $\operatorname{im}(\varphi)$  ? 
 $\textsf{M}_B(\varphi)$  is the transformation matrix. I've read that you'd just transpose the matrix  $\textsf{M}_B(\varphi)$  and row reduce to calculate a basis. I just don't get it. 
 The solution according to the solution it should be the basis  $$ \left\{\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & -2  \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1  \end{pmatrix} \right\}$$ 
 Also little side questions. I do know about 
 $$\dim(A) = \dim(\operatorname{im} A) + \dim(\ker A)$$ 
but how exactly do you know the dimension of the Kernel/Image?

 Suppose each new human born has the knowledge of the total number of humans born so far. So in their life, each human multiplies that number by 20 to get the upper bound for the total number of humans. 
 Assuming humans will eventually go extinct, 95% of the humans will calculate the upper bound correctly using the 'multiply by 20' rule. 
 But still, does that really imply that the number that I calculate right now would be correct with 95% accuracy? 
 What if we repeat this experiment to check if my calculation really works 95% of the time? 
 For each experiment, God randomly chooses a natural number N (as the total number of humans to be born). Assuming there is only one point in time when I can be born (which seems like a valid assumption), in each experiment, I'm always born as the  $n$ th human. So the upper bound I calculate is always  $20n$ . 
 Now it's easy to see that my calculation will be correct in 0% of these experiments, instead of 95. 
 So what is the correct probability? 0% or 95%?

"As all my other questions, this one isn't homework (it's preparation for an exam). 
 I'd like to know if I did everything correctly.  In my previous task, I had a mistake in the first derivation. But for this task, I think everything is alright. 
 
 Find all local extremums of the following function and decide if these
  are global extremums (i.e. maxima or rather minima of the function on
  its entire domain) or not: 
 $f:\mathbb{R}\ni x\mapsto x^{2}e^{-x} \in \mathbb{R}$ 
 
 I have started by checking the behavior of $f$ towards $+- \infty$ to see it more clear / see at all if the extremums are global or local. And for finding the limit, I had to use L'Hôpitals rule twice (not shown to keep it short). 
 $$\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}f(x)=0$$ 
 $$\lim_{x\rightarrow-\infty}f(x)=\infty$$ 
 This already tells me that on the left (negative) side of the coordinate system, there will be endlessly extremums. $\Rightarrow$ The function cannot have any global extremums. 
 Now derivate $f$ and calculate the extremum: 
 $$f'(x)=e^{-x}(2x-x^{2})$$ 
 $\Rightarrow$ 
 $$f'(x)=0$$ 
 $$0=\frac{1}{e^x}(2x-x^{2})$$ 
 $$0=2x-x^{2}$$ 
 $$x^{2}=2x$$ 
 $$x=2$$    
 Now use the $2^{nd}$ derivation to check if this is a maximum or minimum. It's a local maximum in point $P(2|\frac{4}{e^{2}})$.

"this is not about getting an answer for this problem, but to create models for solve them, below I will show a simple puzzle in order to demonstrate what I mean: 
 Lets say two friends just left a bar with 8 liters of alcohol in an weird bottle with 8 liters. You on the other hand want half of this amount, and he is willing to give it to you based on your friendship. However you have two bottles one with 5 liters and the other one with 3. And you want to divide it the in a half while keeping your own bottles. 
 Things that must assume as true:
1. You won't be able to calculate the volume of any bottle based on its shape (not even with surface integrals, weird theorems from vector calculus, etc)
2. You don't have anything to measure any volume despite of the bottles. 
 So to make it simpler to understand: 
 three bottles: 
-> 8 liters (full)
-> 5 liters
-> 3 liters
 
 And each person must have 4 liters 
 (at the end of changing fluids from one bottle to another one) 
 One solution: 
 Fill the 3 one with the 8.
Then, move from 3 to five.
Then, fill again the 3 one.
Fill the 5 one (and there will be one liter left in the 3)
then fill the 8, with the 5, move the one liter to the 5 and finally fill the 3.
 
 There you'll have: 
 -> 8 (filled with 4)
-> 5 (filled with 1)
-> 3 (full)

"One such value is $\displaystyle\cos\left(2\pi\alpha\right)+i\sin\left(2\pi\alpha\right)$, by Euler's theorem. On the other hand, we can choose an arbitrary sequence $S=(a_n)_n$ of rational numbers converging to $\alpha$, pick up $a_n=p_n/q_n\in S$ and calculate possible values of $e^{2i\pi p_n/q_n}$. The $q_n$ part will open many branches, but eventually $p_n$ will make some of them become equal. It is not clear whether the number of solutions is growing.  
 Because multivaluedness can cause serious headaches sometimes, let's define some things. Cosine and sine are defined by the usual taylor series and exponentiation by a natural number remains untouched. Roots are calculated by this procedure: $\mathbf{1^{1/q_n}}$ is defined to be the  set  $$\mathbf{1^{1/q_n}}=\{z:z\in\mathbb{C}\wedge z^{q_n}=1\}.$$  
 We, then, define $\mathbf{1^{p_n/q_n}}$ to be the  set  $K_n=\{z^{p_n}:z\in\mathbb{C}\wedge z^{q_n}=1\}$. To avoid even more problems, we let $p_n$ and $q_n$ be coprime. 
 How is the cardinality of $K_n=\mathbf{1^{p_n/q_n}}$ growing over time? I have no intuition in this opening and closing branches game. I want to know the limit $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}|K_n|$ and a rigorous proof of it.

"A horizontal regression is defined as the following: 
 $$m=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\operatorname{average(x)})(y_i-\operatorname{average(y))}}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\operatorname{average(x)})^2}$$ 
 whereas a vertical regression is defined as 
 $$m=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\operatorname{average(y)})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\operatorname{average(x))}(y_i-\operatorname{average(y))}}$$ 
 In several math-books it says that you use the horizontal regression if you want to calculate the x values to given y values and the vertical regression formula if you want to find the corresponding y values to given x values. 
 But how can it be that the function I get with the vertical regression formula is more accurate than the horizontal one for x on y values? 
 For example: 
 $ x := \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ 
 $ y := \{0.3,0.5,0.7,1,1,1.5,1.6,2.1\}$ 
 That gives me the vertical function: $f(x)=0.24404*x-0.0107$
and the horizontal function: $f(x)=0.25256*x-0.04902$ 
 If I calculate the least-squares-sum (x on y):  
 $$\sum_{i=0}^7 (x_i-f(y_i))^2$$ 
 I get 181.33... for the vertical one but 183.14... for the horizontal one.  
 Why is in general the horizontal regression associated with ""x on y"" if the vertical one obviously be more accurate?

 $$ 2C^n_{2n-1}=\frac{2(2n-1)!}{n!(n-1)!}=\frac{2n(2n)!}{n!n!(2n)}=\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}$$ 
 $$ 4C^n_{2n-2}=\frac{4(2n-2)!}{n!(n-2)!}=\frac{4(2n)!(n)(n-1)}{(2n)(2n-1)(n!)^2}=\frac{2(2n)!(n-1)}{(2n-1)(n!)^2}$$ 
 $$ 2^nC_n^n=2^n$$ 
 So our original sum is equal to this:

"$\newcommand{\eps}{\epsilon}$I tried to illustrate the problem in the picture below. An ellipse is rotated by the angle $\alpha$. Since the distance $L$ is given, the tangent to the ellipse can be determined. The angular coordinate $\beta$ is used to describe the tangent point. $\beta$ is measured from the the body-fixed $x$-axis of the ellipse.  
 
 For further calculations I want to determine $\frac{d\beta}{d\alpha}$. Therefore I tried to calculate $\beta = f(\alpha)$ or at least $\cos(\beta) = f(\alpha)$ and $\sin(\beta) = f(\alpha)$. 
 My approach is to solve the following equation $-y \frac{dx}{d \beta}+x \frac{dy}{d \beta}=0$, where $x = L + r\cos(\beta+\alpha)$ and $y = r \sin(\beta+\alpha)$. $(x,y)$ is the tangent point. The equation follows from the scalar product of $(\frac{dx}{d \beta},\frac{dy}{d \beta})$ and the vector between $0$ and $(x,y)$ rotated by $90°$. I simplified the equation using Mathematica to:
$$
(-1 + \eps^2) L \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - b \sqrt{1 - \eps^2 \cos(\beta)^2} + L \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) = 0,
$$
where $\eps$ is the numerical eccentricity of the ellipse.  
 However, the solution Mathematica provides to this equation is not practical, since I have to do a case distinction. I feel like that my approach uses too much calculus and a different approach would simplify the solution.

"I was proving that a reversible ring is 2-Primal for an exercise in T.Y Lam's book, but I got stuck. Here is where I'm stuck: 
let $a$ be a nilpotent element of $R$ with $a^n=0$. Then using reversibility of ring he concluded $(RaR)^n=0$, but then he says this implies that 
$RaR\subset \mathrm{Nil}_\ast(R)$ which clearly gives 2-primality as then $\mathrm{Nil}_\ast(R)=$ set of all nilpotent elements.  
 
 But why is $RaR\subset \mathrm{Nil}_{*}(R)$? 
 
 $\mathrm{Nil}_\ast(R)$ is the set of elements $x$ s.t. every m-system containing $x$ intersects $0$. It is always contained in the set of all nilpotent elements of $R$. ""2-primal"" means that the nilpotent elements are all contained in $\mathrm{Nil}_\ast(R)$. 
 please suggest something.. 
 also tell me if we have to calculate $\mathrm{Nil}_{*}(R)$ for some ring what should we aim at. we can't find all m-systems. we know it is a nil ideal so every element is nilpotent and it is contained in $rad(R)$ and intersection of all prime ideals but we also can't find all prime ideals. so what should we do to find $\mathrm{Nil}_{*}(R)$

"Fun with Math  time.  
 My mom gave me a roll of toilet paper to put it in the bathroom, and looking at it I immediately wondered about this: is it possible, through very simple math, to calculate (with small error) the total paper length of a toilet roll?  
 Writing down some math, I came to this study, which I share with you because there are some questions I have in mind, and because as someone rightly said: for every problem there always are at least 3 solutions. 
 I started by outlining the problem in a geometrical way, namely looking only at the essential: the roll from above, identifying the salient parameters: 
 
 Parameters 
 $r = $ radius of internal circle, namely the paper tube circle; 
 $R = $ radius of the whole paper roll; 
 $b = R - r = $ ""partial"" radius, namely the difference of two radii as stated. 
 First Point 
 I treated the whole problem in the discrete way. [See the end of this question for more details about what does it mean] 
 Calculation 
 In a discrete way, the problem asks for the total length of the rolled paper, so the easiest way is to treat the problem by thinking about the length as the sum of the whole circumferences starting by radius $r$ and ending with radius $R$.
But how many circumferences are there?  
 Here is one of the main points, and then I thought about introducing a new essential parameter, namely the thickness of a single sheet. Notice that it's important to have to do with measurable quantities. 
 Calling $h$ the thickness of a single sheet, and knowing $b$ we can give an estimate of how many sheets $N$ are rolled: 
 $$N = \frac{R - r}{h} = \frac{b}{h}$$ 
 Having to compute a sum, the total length $L$ is then: 
 $$L = 2\pi r + 2\pi (r + h) + 2\pi (r + 2h) + \cdots + 2\pi R$$ 
 or better: 
 $$L = 2\pi (r + 0h) + 2\pi (r + h) + 2\pi (r + 2h) + \cdots + 2\pi (r + Nh)$$ 
 In which obviously $2\pi (r + 0h) = 2\pi r$ and $2\pi(r + Nh) = 2\pi R$.
Writing it as a sum (and calculating it) we get: 
 $$
\begin{align}
L = \sum_{k = 0}^N\ 2\pi(r + kh) & = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1}\ 2\pi(r + kh)
\\\\
& = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + 2\pi \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1} r + 2\pi h \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1} k
\\\\
& = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + 2\pi r(N-1) + 2\pi h\left(\frac{1}{2}N(N-1)\right)
\\\\
& = 2\pi r N + 2\pi R + \pi hN^2 - \pi h N
\end{align}
$$ 
 Using now: $N = \frac{b}{h}$; $R = b - a$ and $a = R - b$ (because $R$ is easily measurable), we arrive after little algebra to 
 $$\boxed{L = 4\pi b + 2\pi R\left(\frac{b}{h} - 1\right) - \pi b\left(1 + \frac{b}{h}\right)}$$ 
 Small Example: 
 $h = 0.1$ mm; $R = 75$ mm; $b = 50$ mm thence $L = 157$ meters 
 which might fit. 
 Final Questions: 
 1) Could it be a good approximation? 
 2) What about the $\gamma$ factor? Namely the paper compression factor? 
 3) Could exist a similar calculation via integration over a spiral path? Because actually it's what it is: a spiral. 
 Thank you so much for the time spent for this maybe tedious maybe boring maybe funny question!

 I understand that for a curve like

the process of finding an orthogonal trajectory involves finding the gradient $dy/dx$ in terms of y and x only. We can then use this expression to calculate the orthogonal trajectory's gradient (the negative reciprocal of $dy/dx$) and solve it to get a function of y in terms of x. 
 My textbook says g is a parameter but says nothing about c. Does this mean g will appear in the expression for the orthogonal trajectory? If so, is this because a parameter in the equation of a family of curves affects the shape of the orthogonal trajectory and hence must appear in the expression for the latter?

"(Note: limited to  $\mathbb{R}$ ) 
 (Note: Geometric here means  with straightedge and compass ) 
 Standard approaches to introducing the concept of Logarithm rely on a previous exposition of the exponential or simply on that of a power. It then receives the dull definition of ""the  inverse  of the power"". 
 A more intuitive and accessible introduction, which allows doing so even at grade 9, is that of the  integer  (discrete) logarithm ( $\mbox{i}\hspace{-0.15em}\log_b(x)\equiv \lfloor\log_b(x)\rfloor$ ), i.e., through repeated division by  the base  without ever getting a result smaller than 1. Ex: 8 can consecutively be divided 3 times by 2 (8/2/2/2) before the results gets smaller than 1. Hence  $\operatorname{ilog}_2(8)=3$ .  
 All the usual properties of logarithms can be derived from such a definition, albeit presumably only for integers. 
 I'm looking, however, for a  geometric description for  $\log_b(x)$  (not just the integer one  $\mbox{i}\hspace{-0.15em}\log_b(x)$ )  and geometric construction of the integer logarithm  $\operatorname{ilog}_b(x)$ . 
 I think I have such a geometric  description : 
 
 $\log_b(x)$  is the ratio in which a 1/x contraction stretches to 1 relative to the case of a 1/b contraction . 
 
 or alternatively 
 
 $\log_b(x)$  is the ratio in which a stretch by a factor of x contracts to 1 relative to the case of a stretch by a factor of b . 
 
 Example: A contraction of 1/16 can be dilated (""zoom in"") 4 times by a factor of 2 to recover the original size, while that of 1/8 can be stretch 3 times by the same factor. Hence  $\log_8(16)=4/3$ .  
 By the same definition it is  $\log_y(x)\,=\,1/\log_x(y)$  and thus  $\log_{16}(8)=3/4$ . 
 The fundamental law of the logarithm should come equally simple from there: 
 $$\log_b(x)\,=\,\log_{b'}(x)\,\log_b(b')$$ 
 This description of the logarithm is reminiscent of that of the cross-ratio, namely a ratio of ratios, and applies to lengths, areas and volumes. 
 However, in terms of geometric constructibility, the Gelfond-Schneider theorem would seem to rule that out in most of the cases as  $\log_b(x)$  is either rational or transcendental. But what about the integer logarithm,  
 
 Is there a construction by compass and ruler of  $\mbox{i}\hspace{-0.15em}\log_b(x)$ ?   
 If a geometric construction would be impossible, what is the proof or a sketch of it?   
 Given the above definition in terms of ratio of dilations, would projective geometry provide for a better insight? 
 In this sense, is that resemblance to the cross-ratio more than a coincidence? 
 
 Note: Calculus would seem to provide us with what looks like a geometric description as the area,  $A(x)$ , of  $f(x)=1/x$  between  $1$  and  $x$ . I don't like such an answer, however, because (1) it doesn't provide intuition on how to calculate it (makes an ad hoc reference to an hyperbola) and (2)  $\log_b(x)$  is still but the ratio of two numbers, namely,  $A(x)/A(b)$ , so the above geometric description would seem to encompass this other one. 
 EDIT: Added pictures: 
 
 Turning the dial A of a machine by 1 notch left/right scales the area of all your objects down/up by a factor of two; similarly, dial B works by a factor of 8. Hence, 3 turns of dial A transforms the green, unit square into the orange rectangle, while 4 turns makes it into the big salmon square. How much do you need to turn dial B in order to get the green, unit square into the salmon big square? Ans: 4/3 of a notch.  
 
 Is the log an intrinsic projective measure? FWIW, Poincare hyperbolic distance d_h(p,q) is a projective measure involving the log of a cross-ratio.  
 As mentioned in my second comment to this post, the discussion in  here  and the article referenced there may give a hint on this last point. Roughly, a metric tensor on the upper half-plane is given by  $ds^2=(dx^2+dy^2)/y^2$ , which translates into  $ds^2=(dx^2+dy^2)/(1-r^2),\;r^2=x^2+y^2<1$  for the Poincare disc.

"I noticed an interesting behavior with the binomial coefficient I find intuitive but can't yet to prove myself. 
 Why is  ${n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}$ ? 
 It seems intuitive due to the way the formula is written: 
 $${n \choose k}=\frac{n!}{(n−k)!k!}$$ 
 and the fact is it is used to calculate the the binomial probability mass function so that  ${n \choose k}$  is equal for both  $n (\text{success})$  and  $n-k (\text{failure})$  (again only for binomial probability of either success or failure and not other option to count for)..

 Question 
 
 A person consumes wine with alcoholic content 13%. 
14.9g of alcohol is the maximum amount of wine allowed to be consumed each day.
Assume 1 ml alcohol has a mass of 0.789g. 
 How many ml of wine could they drink each day if their consumption was upper limit? 
 
 My answer: 
 
 Figure out how much 14.9g (weight) of alcohol is in space (volume): 
 $$14.9 / 0.789 = 18.88466413181242~\text{ml}$$ 
 
 We know that the maximum space the alcohol can take up out of the whole of amount of wine is 18.88466413181242ml 
 So 13% of that wine must not exceed 18.8...ml, but since we're finding the maximum we'll say that 13% = the 18.8...ml 
 18.88466413181242                   - Maximum amount of ml of alcohol to be drunk  
13% = 18.88466413181242 ml          - Assume the 13% of the wine is the maximum 18.8 ml 
 
 Since 13% of the wine is 18.8ml we'll now calculate what 100% of the wine is: 
 18.88466413181242ml / 13 = 1.452666471677878               - Divide by 13 and × by 100 to get the 100% of the volume in ml 
 1.452666471677878 × 100 = 145ml (rounded)

 I get the result:  $$\frac{1}{2}\left(2^{2n}-\binom{2n}{n}\right)$$  via a numeric argument. 
 My question is: Can we solve it using a combinational argument? 
 My Numeric Argument:   $$\left(\sum^{n}_{r=0}\binom{n}{i}\right)^2=\sum^{n}_{r=0}\binom{n}{i}^2+2\mathop{\sum\sum}_{0\leq i<j\leq n}\binom{n}{i}\cdot \binom{n}{j}$$ 
 So here  $$\displaystyle \sum^{n}_{r=0}\binom{n}{i} = \binom{n}{0}+\binom{n}{1}+.....+\binom{n}{n} = 2^n$$ 
 and  $$\displaystyle \sum^{n}_{r=0}\binom{n}{i}^2=\binom{n}{0}^2+\binom{n}{1}^2+.....+\binom{n}{n}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}$$ 
 above we have calculate Using  $$(1+x)^n = \binom{n}{0}+\binom{n}{1}x+\binom{n}{2}x^2+.....+\binom{n}{n}x^n$$ 
 and  $$(x+1)^n = \binom{n}{0}x^n+\binom{n}{1}x^{n-1}+\binom{n}{2}x^{n-2}+.....+\binom{n}{n}x^0$$ 
 Now calcualting Coefficient of  $x^n$  in  $$(1+x)^n\cdot (x+1)^n = (1+x)^{2n} = \binom{2n}{n}$$ 
 So we get  $$\mathop{\sum\sum}_{0\leq i<j\leq n}\binom{n}{i}\cdot \binom{n}{j} = \frac{1}{2}\left[2^{2n} - \binom{2n}{n}\right]$$

"Let us calculate the volume of the cube using spherical coordinates. The cube has side-length $a$, and we will centre it on the origin of the coordinates. Denote elevation angle by $\theta$, and the azimuthal angle by $\phi$.
Split the cube into 6 identical square based pyramids, by the planes $x = y, x = -y, x = z$ etc.
Take the square-based pyramid with the base on the plane $x = \frac{a}{2}$.
Then this pyramid is described by the following set of inequalities;
$\frac{\pi}{4} < \theta < \frac{3\pi}{4},
\;-\frac{\pi}{4} < \phi < \frac{\pi}{4},
\;0 < x < \frac{a}{2}$ 
 Rewriting the last inequality in polar coordinates gives
$0 < r < \frac{a}{2 \cos(\phi)\sin(\theta)}$
and now we are in a position to write down the integral. 
 $V_\mathrm{cube} = 6 V_\mathrm{pyramid} = 6\iiint_\mathrm{pyramid} r^2 \sin(\theta) \mathrm{d}r \mathrm{d}\theta \mathrm{d}\phi$ 
 Solve first the r integral, which gives  
 $\int_0^\frac{a}{2 \cos(\phi)\sin(\theta)} r^2 dr = \frac{1}{24}\frac{a^3}{ \cos(\phi)^3\sin(\theta)^3}$  
 and so 
 $V_\mathrm{cube} = \frac{a^3}{4} \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^\frac{\pi}{4} \frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\cos(\phi)^3} \int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^\frac{3\pi}{4} \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\sin(\theta)^2}   $ 
 The antiderivative of $\sin^{-2} \theta$ is $-\cot \theta$, so the $\theta$ integral evaluates to 2, giving 
 $V_\mathrm{cube} = \frac{a^3}{2} \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^\frac{\pi}{4} \frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\cos(\phi)^3}$

"I am kind of stuck on a problem that goes as follows. 
 There are two coins in front of you, one is fair, the other has probability 3/4 of ‘Heads’. You take one of the two coins (without knowing if it is the fair one or the other one), and toss it n times. Let $X_n=\frac{number.\: of\: heads}{n}$ 
 (a) How would you make a prediction (from the value of Xn) on whether the coin is the fair one or the biased one? 
 b) Using Chebyshev’s inequality, show that for n ≥ 320, the prediction is correct with probability at least 95%.

"My friend has 2 biased coins. He flips the first one a number of times
and tells my how many heads and tails he saw, then repeats this for
the second one. I have no influence on how many trials he does, though
I am guranteed at least one per coin. My job now is to tell him which
coin is better; i.e. which one has a higher probability of showing
heads. 
 The obvious way to do this would be to estimate the probabilities from
the samples, however this seems wrong to me because I am not taking
into account how accurate my estimates are. E.g., consider
the case where: 
 
 Coin 1 has shown 501 heads and 499 tails. 
 Coin 2 has shown 2 heads and 1 tails. 
 
 I tried approaching this in a few ways, and all of those quickly
showed me how little I know about probability theory and statistics. 
 My question has four main points: 
 
 Does this problem depend on how the coin probabilities are distributed? (If so, assume a uniform distribution.) 
 How do I calculate how likely either answer is correct or wrong, given the two samples? 
 Is there a strategy that is more often correct (or less often wrong) than the obvious one?

 Ok, so: I know that, for a function to be a linear transformation, it needs to verify two properties: 
 
 1: T (u+v) = T (u) + T (v) 
 2: c.T (u) = T (c.u) 
 
 This is what I will need to solve in the exam, I mean, this kind of exercise: 
 
 T: R3 -> R3 / T (x; y; z) = (x+z; -2x+y+z; -3y) 
 
 The thing is, that I can't seem to find a way to verify the first property. I'm writing nonsense things or trying to do things without actually knowing what I am doing, or why I am doing it. I first tried to make two generic vectors, then tried to apply the function on it... but it looks horrible. Fun fact: I'm not having big troubles with solving R2 to R2 exercises, but I can't seem to find a way to solve this one.

 Find the critical points of $f$, when we look at it as a function that is defined only at $\partial U$.  
 Calculate the value of $f$ at all the critical points.

 We have to do the following steps:  
 
 Find all the critical points of $f$ in $U=(-1, 1) \times (-1, 1)$.  
 Find the critical points of $f$, when we look at it as a function that is defined only at $\partial U$.  
 Calculate the value of $f$ at all the critical points.  
 Compare all these values and pick the greatest one and the smallest one.  
 
 First step :  
 $$\nabla f=(y, x)$$  
 $$\nabla f=0 \Rightarrow y=0 \text{ and } x=0$$  
 The only critical point in $U$ is $$(0, 0)$$  
 Second step :  
 $\partial U=A\cup B\cup C\cup D$ with
\begin{eqnarray*}
A &=&\left\{ (x,-1):-1\leq x\leq 1 \right\}  \\
B &=&\left\{ (1 ,y):-1\leq y\leq 1 \right\}  \\

D &=&\left\{ (-1,y):-1\leq y\leq 1 \right\} .

 $$A: f(x, -1)=-x=g(x) \\ g'(x)=0 \Rightarrow -1=0$$ 
$$B: f(1, y)=y=g(y) \\ g'(y)=0 \Rightarrow 1=0$$ 
$$C: f(x, 1)=x=g(x) \\ g'(x)=0 \Rightarrow 1=0$$ 
$$D: f(-1, y)=-y=g(y) \\ g'(y)=0 \Rightarrow -1=0$$ 
That means that there are no critical points on the boundary $\partial{U}$.  
 Third step :  
 The value of $f$ at the critical point $(0, 0)$ is $f(0, 0)=0$.  
 Is it correct so far??  
 Forth step :  
 How can $f$ have an absolute maximum and minimum value if there is only one critical point?? Or have I done something wrong??

"I was trying to solve the following homework probability question which has the following setup: 
 
 We have  $2$  dice:  $A$  and  $B$ . Die  $A$  has  $4$  red faces and  $2$  white faces, whereas die  $B$  has  $2$  red faces and  $4$  white faces. On each turn, a fair coin is tossed. If the coin lands on heads then die  $A$  is thrown, but if the coin lands on tails then die  $B$  is thrown. After this the turn ends, and on the next turn the coin is once again tossed to determine the die (i.e. we throw the coin and the corresponding die on each turn). 
 
 From this game I'm asked to answer  $2$  questions: 
 
 
 Show that the probability of obtaining a red face on any  $n$ -th throw is  $\frac{1}{2}$ . 
 If the first  $2$  consecutive die throws result in red faces, what is the probability that the third throw is also red? 
 
 
 
 To answer part  $1$  I used the law of total probability. Denoting obtaining a red face on the  $n$ -th die throw as  $P(R_n)$  I get 
 \begin{align*}
P(R_n) &= P(R_n \vert A) P(A) + P(R_n \vert B) P( B) \\
& = \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\\
& = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align*} 
 But on question  $2$  is where I started running into trouble. Using the same notation, what I want to calculate is  $P(R_3 \vert R_2 R_1)$ . And recalling that for events  $E_1$  and  $E_2$  we can say that
 $$
P(E_2 \vert E_1) = \frac{P(E_2E_1)}{P(E_1)}
$$ 
I get that
 $$
P(R_3 \vert R_2 R_1) = \frac{P(R_3 R_2 R_1)}{P(R_2 R_1)} \tag{1}
$$ 
and from here I obtain 2 different solutions using  $2$  distinct methods: 
 Answer 1 
 Using that on the first part of the question we showed that  $P(R_n) = \frac{1}{2}$ , and noticing that the die throws are independent since what I threw before does not affect how I throw the next coin toss or how I roll the next die, from equation  $(1)$  I get
 \begin{align*}
P(R_3 \vert R_2 R_1) &= \frac{P(R_3 R_2 R_1)}{P(R_2 R_1)}\\
&= \frac{P(R_3) P(R_2) P(R_1)}{P(R_2) P(R_1)}\\
& = P(R_3) = P(R_n) = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align*} 
 Answer 2 
 Using the law of total probability on  $(1)$  I get
 \begin{align*}
P(R_3 \vert R_2 R_1) & = \frac{P(R_1 R_2  R_3 \vert A)P(A)+ P(R_1  R_2  R_3 \vert B)P(B)}{P(R_1  R_2 \vert A ) P(A)+ P(R_1  R_2 \vert B) P(B)}\\
&= \frac{\left[\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\right]\frac{1}{2}+ \left[\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\right]\frac{1}{2}}{\left[\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\right]\frac{1}{2}+\left[\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\right]\frac{1}{2}}\\
& = \frac{3}{5}
\end{align*} 
 
 To me both of the previous answers seem to be following coherent logic, but since I didn't get the same answer I knew one of them was wrong. I decided to write a program to simulate the game and I found out that the  correct  solution was  $P(R_3 \vert R_2 R_1) = \frac{3}{5}$ . But even though I verified this answer to be correct I couldn't seem to understand what part of my analysis is wrong on  Answer 1 . 
 So my question is, why is

"Firstly, what does it mean to calculate a  statistic ?  Do they just want us to find the mean, variance, and standard deviation?  For instance, if I'm asked to calculate the statistic of the Chi squared with three degrees of freedom or the F distribution with 1 and 2 degrees of freedom how would I go about doing that?  The assumptions are that $X_i$ is independent with $N(i,i^{2})$ distributions.  I'm asked to use the $X_i$ to construct the statistics.   
 Would i just use the formulas: 
 $$\sum_{n=1}^{n} (X_{1}+...+X_{n})/n = mean$$ 
 and 
 $$\sum_{n=1}^{n} (X_i-mean)^{2}/n-1 = variance$$ 
 So if you do use these formulas how can you evaluate all the $X_1$ to $X_n$ values?  How is knowing just the type of distribution and its respective degrees of freedom going to help me come up with the individual random sample values?  Or is my understanding completely incorrect?

 Let  $S_n$  be the group of all permutations of the set  $X=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ . Given a permutation  $\sigma\in S_n$ , let  $f(\sigma)$  denote the number of fixed points of  $\sigma$ .

 $$\frac 1{|S_n|}\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}f(\sigma)=1$$ 
 b.  Find the average value of  $f(\sigma)^2$ . 
 
 All that comes to my mind is to use Inclusion Exclusion Principle to calculate the number of combinations for a given value of  $f(\sigma)$ . That is, explicitly calculate the number of permutations of  $X$  with exactly  $r$  fixed points, denoted by  $S_n(r)$ . But, that is not a very easy task since we are doing it for a general  $n$  which means  $S_n(r)$  will be in the form of a summation, all of which needs to be summed again over all  $r$ . Also, this approach is not quite elegant. It becomes a real headache however in  b  since there you need to take a square as well. Also, we are never really using any property of permutation groups while solving this problem. 
 Is there any other approach that can make life easier?

"An exam centre is going to prepare question papers for 160 students where each paper has 9 questions from 9 different topics (one question per topic). They can allow upto 2 collisions, i.e. at most 2 out of the 9 questions can be the same for any two of the papers. What is the minimum number of questions that should be prepared for each topic? 
 My work follows: 
 First I tried to find out what is total number of total questions that needs to be prepared. I was thinking of using Inclusion-Exclusion principle but then it's too big to calculate the cardinality of the union of 160 sets. 
 Then I started to work on small number of sets starting from 2, 3, 4, ... and progressing in the hope of finding any pattern or logic. Finally it would be like a 160 x 9 matrix where no two rows have more than 2 elements in common.
I prepared the first few rows as shown below: 
 A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 F1 G1 H1 I1 
 A1 B2 C2 D2 E1 F2 G2 H2 I2 
 A2 B1 C2 D3 E2 F1 G2 H3 I3 
 A3 B3 C1 D2 E2 F3 G1 H2 I3 
 A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I 
 I am getting stuck at the 5th row and not able to bring 2 elements common from first 4 rows. Not able to determine if it is logically bound to happen or is there something wrong in my initial technique of optimisation. 
 1 Paper: Minimum number of total questions = 9 
 2 Papers: Minimum number of total questions = 9 + 7 = 16 
 3 Papers: Minimum number of total questions = 9 + 7 + 5 = 21 
 4 Papers: Minimum number of total questions = 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 24 
 5 Papers: Minimum no. of total questions = 9 + 7 + 5 + ? = ? 
 Next another thought came to my mind.  
 I've been thinking about the simpler case where there is at most one collision. (That is, questions may be re-used, but not in a way that two exam papers contain the same two questions.) 
 Suppose we only need two questions (denoted by A and B topic questions) instead of 9. With just two questions, the ""one-collision"" requirement is the same as saying all the papers are unique.) Then we can show that 26 questions suffices to generate 160 papers. Here's how: 
 First, we show there have to be at least 26 questions. This comes from the pigeonhole principle. Let k be the number of A questions. Then there is some A question that occurs at least 160/k times, and so we
need at least 160/k B questions to go with this one, for a total of k + 160/k (rounded up to the next integer) questions. The minimum value of this expression is 26, which occurs for all k in the range 10 <= k <= 16. 
 But I am not able to generate an idea on how to proceed to solve the given problem. How to Mathematically model the problem statement? What I am not very sure about is whether we try to find out the smallest number of total questions required, say Q, for a subset of N papers and then our answer shall be Q*(floor(160/N)) + Q', where Q' is smallest number of total questions required for the remaining 160 - N*(floor (160/N)) papers. 
 Please, help me as I am missing the required optimisation strategy to be used.

"I have the cardioid $r=1+cos(t)$ for $0\leq{t}\leq{2\pi}$ and I want to calculate the surface of revolution of said curve. How can I calculate it? 
 The parematrization of the cardioid is: 
 $$x(t)=(1+cos(t))cos(t)$$
$$y(t)=(1+cos(t))sin(t)$$
and 
$$\frac{dx}{dt}=\left(-2\cos\left(t\right)-1\right)\sin\left(t\right)$$
$$\frac{dy}{dt}=\cos\left(t\right)\left(\cos\left(t\right)+1\right)-\sin^2\left(t\right)
$$ 
 To calculate the surface of revolution I know I can use the formula (since I want to revolve it around the x-axis) $$2\pi \int_{a}^{b} y(t)\sqrt{\bigg(\frac{dx}{dt}\bigg)^2+\bigg(\frac{dy}{dt}\bigg)^2}  dt$$
However, when I do that integral, the result is $0$ (using online  calculators ). Why is this wrong? Obviously the surface can't be 0, right? What's the correct answer?

 Transcribed from this image 
 I solved this and got  $\det(P) = 0+0+0+....+ 1(1) = 1$ . So,  $\det(P) = 1$ . Now, we already know that  $\det(I) = 1$  and  $\det(I+5P) = \det(I) + 5 \det(P) = 1 + 5\times 1 = 1 + 5 = 6$ , and
 $\det(I+3P+4P^2) = \det(I) + 3\det(P) + 4\det(P^2) = 1 + 3\times1 + 4\times0 = 1 + 3 = 4$  since  $\det(P^2) = 0$ . 
 Is this correct? Kindly check and let me know if there are any problems. Thanks a lot in advance for your help.

"When calculating the $P$ for at least $x$ success one uses $\text{max} (x-1)$ instead, and then take $1- (\text{max} (x-1))$. This works. And I understand it. Because we use the complement to calculate it, because the calculator supports it. But what I do not understand is the following. When calculating a combination of these, $P(\text{max}\,\, x\,\,\, \text{and}\,\,\, \text{min}\,\, y)$ we can just forget about the $1 - (\text{max}\,\, (x-1))$ part, and just use $\text{max}\,(x-1)$ directly.

I have to calculate limit of this: 
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{\sum_{k=1}^n (k^{999} + \frac{1}{\sqrt k})}$$ 
At first point. I see it's some limit of $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{1^{999} + \frac{1}{\sqrt 1} + 2^{999} + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \dots + n^{999} + \frac {1}{\sqrt n} }$$ 
And now is generally my doubt. Can i assume that if this limit goes to one then if limit of larger sequence goes to one too, then my original sequence goes to one too?  
 I came up with something like this. 
 if $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sqrt[n]{\sum_{k=1}^n k^{1000}}$$ this limit goes to one ( cause obviously, expression under original sum is much lower than second sum ) then original limit goes to one too.  
 But i made it even simplier. 
$$\sum_{k=1}^n k^{1000} < n^{1001}$$, so... 
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sqrt[n]{n^{1001}}$$ this limit obviously goes to 1. Ans my final answer is that original limit goes to one too.
I did some kind of bounding. But i'm not sure if i can do it. Any answers and tips are going to be greatly appreciated :-) Thanks.

"I am trying to formulate an optimisation problem (which I think I have done correctly) but am struggling in solving it when substituting in a sample function, which leads me to think that maybe the formulation is incorrect, so would like to see where my error(s) were made. Assuming the formulation is correct, is there an analytical solution? 
 Consider some function  $$F = f(x,g(x))$$  where we wish to find the minimum. 
 Taking:  $$F'(x) = \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} + \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{g}} \frac{\partial{g}}{\partial{x}} = 0$$ 
 We should be able to solve for  $x$ . 
 Now consider  $$f(x,g(x)) =  x-xg(x) - x g(x)^2$$ 
 $$g(x) = \Phi(x) = {\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}\int _{-\infty }^{x}e^{-t^{2}/2}\,dt$$ 
where  $\Phi(x)$  is the cdf of a Normal distribution (although any cdf should work). 
 Attempting to calculate the partial derivatives and substituting into the above gives: 
 $$F'(x) = 1-g-g^2 + \left( -x(1+2g)\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2} \right) = 0$$ 
 where I've dropped  $(x)$  from the notation for simplicity. 
 Assuming this is correct then I have a formula still in terms of both  $x$  and  $g(x)$ , and no easy substitution given  $g(x)$  is an integral. Is my approach totally wrong here, or is this equation more solvable than it looks?

 How could I write $y=\ln(x)+x$ as $x^2=...$ 
 
 Since there might be another solution to this problem I'll give some background. So I had a math test yesterday where they wanted you to calculate the volume of (V) when turned around the y-axis, see here: 
   
 The formula for this is pretty easy: $\pi r^2h-\int_a^b(x)^2 dy$  
 The notation might be different (Dutch) so h is the height of a cylinder, and $\int_a^b(x)^2 dy$ means the integral of the primitive of $(x)^2$.  
 Since the formula needs $x^2$ it has to be written in that way.  
 
 The math test was a pretty big bummer, even more so since I learned hard for it and understood all of the higher concepts but I (and many others) stranded on the basic things like this.  
 
 Normally they make the concepts more complicated so you have to combine multiple, however this time there were just a lot of hard things like the above, writing $y=\ln(x)+x$ as $x^2=...$. They don't seem to require a lot of insight more so knowing the rules. Particularly if the book and your teacher don't even explain what things like $\ln$ and e actually mean.  
 Is there a way to learn solving these problems which require rules with understanding when your high school teacher/ book doesn't tell you about it? I really like trying to understand math but this seems more like just learning the rules. Is there a way to mix these two together? For instance a book on mixing high school calculus together with a deeper insight.  
 This is my first stackexchange post so I hope it's fine, I couldn't find anything about asking multiple questions at the same time so I hope it's allowed. 
 I also couldn't find anything about these the required level of math so I hope my high school math is allowed, if not I'd still like to know the answer to my second question. Which I think is more important and would allow me to enjoy math more anyway. That's why I like to look at stackexchange, things don't just get answered; insight is provided.

 Is the number  $$(11!)!+11!+1$$  a prime number ? 
 
 I do not expect that a probable-prime-test is feasible, but if someone actually wants to let it run, this would of course be very nice. The main hope is to find a factor to show that the number is not prime. If we do not find a factor, it will be difficult to check the number for primality. I highly expect a probable-prime-test to reveal that the number is composite.  ""Composite"" would be a surely correct result. Only if the result would be ""probable prime"", there would remain slight doubts, but I would be confident with such a test anyway. 
 Motivation :  $(n!)!+n!+1$  can only be prime if  $\ n!+1\ $  is prime. This is because a non-trivial factor of  $\ n!+1\ $  would also divide  $\ (n!)!+n!+1\ $ . The cases  $\ n=2,3\ $  are easy , but the case  $\ n=11\ $  is the first non-trivial case. We only know that there is no factor upto  $\ p=11!+1\ $ 
 What I want to know : Can we calculate  $$(11!)!\mod \ p$$  for  $\ p\ $  having  $\ 8-12\ $  digits with a trick ? I ask because pari/gp takes relatively long to calculate this residue directly. So, I am looking for an acceleration of this trial division.

"Frank Warner's book, chapter 2, excercise 13 states the following: 
 
 If $V$ is an oriented inner product space ($n$ dimensional) there is a linear map $\ast \colon \Lambda (V) \to \Lambda (V)$, called star, which is well-defined by the requirement that for  any  orthonormal basis $e_1,\dots,e_n$ of $V$ (in particular, for any re-ordering of a given basis),
  $\ast(1) = \pm e_1 \wedge \dots \wedge e_n$, $\ast(e_1 \wedge \dots \wedge e_n) = \pm 1$, $\ast(e_1 \wedge \dots \wedge e_k) = \pm e_{k+1} \wedge \dots \wedge e_n$, where one takes ""+"" if $e_1 \wedge \dots \wedge e_n$ lies on the component of $\Lambda^n(V)-\{0\}$ determined by the orientation and ""-"" otherwise. Observe that $\ast\colon \Lambda^k(V) \to \Lambda^{n-k}(V)$. Prove that on $\Lambda^k(V)$, $\ast\ast = (-1)^{k(n-k)}$. 
 
 A prior part of that exercise was to show that if we have an ONB $e_1,\dots,e_n$ of $V$ then the corresponding basis of $\Lambda(V)$ is orthonormal (after extending the inner product to $\Lambda(V)$ in the usual way), which I already accomplished. 
 But now I'm having trouble with his definition of $\ast$. How can I calculate $\ast$ on all other basis elements, i.e. $\ast(e_{i_1}\wedge \dots \wedge e_{i_k})$? What exactly does he mean with ""for any re-ordering of a given basis""? Or is there any other way to prove the claim? 
 Clarification: I know how the $\ast$ acts on general elements from many other sources, my question here is, if the claim follows by only knowing $\ast(e_1 \wedge \dots \wedge e_k) = e_{k+1} \wedge \dots \wedge e_n$ if my basis has the ""right"" orientation.

"A forum RPG I'm part of is working on a scaled/weighted rolling system for combat and other competitive skill checks, to prevent god-modding (a practice where players say their characters always win/succeed just because they want to). The idea is that based on an individual character's ""level"" they are assigned a specific HP value and a specific range for randomly generated scores, and various characters can roll against each other to determine a victor. These score ranges function as singular die rolls, and therefore have an equal chance of ""rolling"" any number within a given range. 
 For example, 
 Players A and B have decided to duel each other. Player A has 2 HP (meaning if they get ""hit"" twice, they lose) and has a score range of 1-20. Player B has 4 HP, and has a score range of 6-25. Both characters take turns ""rolling"" attack and defense (they randomly generate a number from within their individual score ranges, using a computer number generator) and those numbers are then compared against each other. So if A rolls a 15 attack and B rolls a 13 defense, B is ""hit"" and loses 1 HP. Since B has a range of 6-25, they are capable of rolling attacks that A is  not  capable of defending against, and likewise, A is capable of rolling attacks too low to succeed  even if  B rolls their minimum. Matching attack and defense rolls result in the attacker's favor. This continues until one character has 0 HP left. 
 I know how to calculate the odds of any given roll being successful from either side, but not how to calculate out the odds of a full game going either way. How do I calculate what the chances are that A makes 4 successful attacks  before  B makes 2 successful attacks?  
 Once I know how to solve this problem with one set of numbers, I can apply the process to the rest of the various lineups. I basically just want to see how balanced and smooth the current scaling system is. 
 What I have so far: 
 If A rolls a 1 on their attack, there are 0 out of B's 25 possible rolls that result in B getting hit, for a 0% success chance. If A rolls a 6, there is a 1/25 chance that B gets hit. And so on. Since each of A's possible rolls has a 1/20 (5%) chance of occurring, I added all of the possible hit chances together and divided by 20 for an overall 24% chance to hit B on any given round. Doing the same process with B's possible rolls, they get a 79% chance to hit A on any given round. 
 I'm just not sure what to do to find the odds of an indefinite number of rounds that continues until someone has been hit a specific number of times.

 $f\prime(x) = 4\pi x^2 \\ f\prime(36.4) = 4\pi (36.4)^2 \\= 16649.93$

But, it looks like I will have so much work to calculate the determinant of the hessian matrix to decide if it is maximum, minimum or neither for each possible point. Is there a easiest way to do this (I've tried spherical coordinates but doesn't look like a good idea too)? Maybe I am using the hardest path, since my second order derivatives dont have a good form.

 n pairs of parents attended a parent’s meeting ( 2n people in total).
In the meeting, a delegation of 2k people was randomly chosen  $2n \ge 2k \ge 4$  out of the 2n people. Calculate the expectation and variance of
the number of pairs of parents that were chosen for the delegation. 
 
 I'm trying to solve this question and I'm not confident at all about my attempt.. it feels like I'm shooting in the dark and doing things I don't really understand fully, plus I'm having a hard time with the algebra of calculating the variance so I thought I'll put it on hold until I get the expectation right 
 My attempt: 
 
 Let  $X,X_{i}$  such that 
 $X = $ Numer of pairs of parents that were chosen for the deligation 
 $X_{i} =  \left\{  \begin{array}{lcl} 1 \ \ \ if \ person \ i's \
> partner \ is \ selected\\ 0 \ \ \ else\\ \end{array} \right.$ 
 Note that  $X\ =\frac{1}{2}\ \sum_{i=1}^{2k}X_{i}$ , also note that
 $X_{i\ }\sim HG\left(2n,2,2k\right)$ , as we are choosing 2k times and
are looking for 2 specials (a pair) out of a population of 2n. 
 $E\left(X\right)=E\left(\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{2k}X_{i}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{2k}E\left(X_{i}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{2k}2k\cdot\frac{2}{2n}=\frac{2}{4n}\cdot\left(2k\right)^{2}$ 
 
 first of all, I'm not sure that  $X=X_{i}$ , the whole notion of indicators is very confusing to me..
I'm also not confident that  $X_{i}$  has an HG distribution.

"I have been studying the  Duffing oscillator  rather intensively lately, mainly based on the theory in of the book by Guckenheimer and Holmes. From all that I have gathered, it seems that most dynamical systems show a period doubling cascade before going into chaos. For example, the logistic map and the driven damped pendulum show this behavior. For instance, this a bifurcation diagram for the pendulum:
 
 However, when I calculate numerical solutions of the Duffing oscillator with Mathematica, I am unable to find such a period doubling and the system goes into chaos right away, as this bifurcation diagram shows:
 
 Now I have tweaked and played with parameters and initial values, calculated some parts in more detail, but whatever I try, I still cannot find any period doubling. I find this very puzzling, since apparently period doubling does take place for the Duffing oscillator, according to Guckenheimer and Holmes. Also, I thought that it was a universal phenomenon for chaotic systems. I could not come up with any reason why I fail to find it other than shortcomings of the numerical method of Mathematica I used (I simply used NDSolve and ParametricNDSolve). Could there be any other reason why a period doubling is absent?

"For a random graph G(n,p), I can understand how to calculate the E(X) where X is the number of isolated vertices. However, in the case of fixed N edges (N = cn), I am not sure how to proceed in the same calculation of E(X). I don't think finding  p = N/$ \binom n2$   would work since that would only give number of edges around N, not exactly N. 
What I considered was proceeding by find the probability that a vertex has at least one edge, which I think should be $\frac{n}{n(n-1)/2} = \frac{2}{n-1}$. However this looks wrong to me since this would give >1 probability when n=2. I am not sure how to go ahead, any hint would be very helpful.

 We have that $$\int \cos(z)\sin(z)~\text{d}z= \frac{\sin^2(z)}{2}$$ Also

 Would anyone be able to tell me what conditions are needed on $\Gamma$ and on $f(z)$ to allow one to do this, I would assume that $f(z)$ has to be holomorphic on $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma$ needs to be a simple closed contour but I'm not entirely sure.

 Remark : The function  $\Pi_0(s)$  is the Laplace transform of 
 $$P_0(t) = \exp\left( -\lambda\int_{0}^{t}[1-H(x)]\,\mathrm dx \right)$$  for a cumulative distribution function  $H(x)$  on the non-negative reals, and  $\alpha$  is the mean of  $H(x)$ . 
 My question : I can obtain two different answers for the limit, the second being the negative of the first. What did I do wrong?

 Assuming that I haven't done something silly with the algebra, my  guess  is that has to do with even versus odd powers of  $s$  vis-a-vis  $-s$ . In the first answer, after multiplying by powers of  $s$ , the denominators are even powers ( $4$  and  $2$ ). But in the second answer the denominators are odd powers ( $3$  and  $3$ ). So in some sense, in the first answer I could replace  $s$  with  $-s$  and everything is the same, but in the second answer I have a "" $-$ "" left over.

 $ =\mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\ln\left(1+X_{k}\right)}{\ln2}\leq\frac{n\ln a}{\ln2}\right) $ 
 Now notice that each  $ \frac{\ln\left(1+X_{k}\right)}{\ln2} $  distributed  $ Ber(1/2) $ , and also it is the sum of independent random variables (as measurable functions of independent random variables), so the sum is distributed  $ Bin(n,1/2) $ . Thus: 
 Note that if  $ a>2 $  then the probability would just be  $ 1 $ , so im gonna assume  $ 1<a<2$ . 
 $ \mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\ln\left(1+X_{k}\right)}{\ln2}\leq\frac{n\ln a}{\ln2}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\left\lfloor n\frac{\ln a}{\ln2}\right\rfloor }\binom{n}{k}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{k}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-k}=\frac{1}{2^{n}}\sum_{k=1}^{\left\lfloor n\frac{\ln a}{\ln2}\right\rfloor }\binom{n}{k} $ 
 All I have left to do now is to calcualte

    \frac{\partial y}{\partial b} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial d} \\

 Each element is just a scalar derivative, which we can calculate without any matric calculus. If we do that by hand and then factorise, we end up with:

\frac{\partial y}{\partial \mathbf{W_1}} = \mathbf{h} \mathbf{W_2}

But let's say  $x=6.5\pi$ , would the correct approach be to have the simplified calculation for the first  $6\pi$  and then for the remaining section separately?

"I'm wondering what kind of structures don't contain associativity in the set of its axioms. Are they useful? Where? 
 For example, $\left(\mathbb{Z},-\right)$ and $\left(\mathbb{Q}\setminus\{0\},:\right)$ are pretty good structures which are closed, have identity elements and even inverses  (here : is division) . Although I don't like them, because they are just ""generated"" from well-known groups, and I've just realized that we can similarly create such structures from any group sending $a\star b$ to $ab^{-1}$. Funny, but I can't find other examples which could be interesting, except the non-natural ones.  
 One of the nice things about this kind of structures, for example, a set with closed operation, identity and unique inverse for every element, is that it's possible to calculate the number of non-isomorphic structures of  finite fixed order. Another thing is that we can easily check the axioms from Cayley table. That's all, I suppose.

The two canonical forms of $a$ and $b$ have not an other common prime.

 $a=p \cdot p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k} \text{ and } b=p^{d} \cdot q_1^{d_1} \cdot q_2^{d_2} \cdots q_m^{a_m}$

"Ok it may sound a bit too simple but I am quite confused here. While studying generalized entropic forms, in my case that of $S_q$ or in another words the  Tsallis Entropy , I reach a point where I have to derive the maximal distribution that corresponds to $S_q$. 
 In order for that to be done, one has to impose some constraints and follow the Lagrange parameters method. In this particular case the constraints required would be: 
 \begin{align}
& \int_{0}^{\infty}p(x)dx=1 \quad \text{(Normalization Constraint)} \\
& \langle x_q \rangle=\int_{0}^{\infty}xP(x)dx=X_q \quad \text{(q-mean value)}
\end{align}
where $P(x)$ is called the  Escort Distribution  and is defined as:
\begin{align}
P(x)=\frac{[p(x)]^q}{\int_{0}^{\infty}[p(k)]^qdk}
\end{align}
Now we define the quantity:
\begin{equation}
Φ(x;p;q)=\frac{1-\int_{0}^{\infty}[p(x)]^qdx}{q-1}-α \int_{0}^{\infty}p(x)dx-\beta_q \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}x[p(x)]^qdx}{\int_{0}^{\infty}[p(x)]^qdx}
\end{equation}
and demand that $\partial{Φ}/\partial{p}=0$. By solving that, one ends up with the pdf:
\begin{equation}
p_{opt}(x)=\frac{e_q^{-\beta_q(x-X_q)}}{\int_{0}^{\infty} e_q^{-\beta_q (x'-X_q)}dx'}
\end{equation} 
where $e_q^x$ are the q-expodentials. This $p_{opt}(x)$ is also known as  q-Gaussian  pdf. 
 My problem in deriving the pdf, is that I am not able to see how to calculate the quantity: 
 \begin{equation}
\frac{\partial{}}{\partial{p}}\left( \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}x[p(x)]^qdx}{\int_{0}^{\infty}[p(x)]^qdx}\right)
\end{equation}  
 Perhaps treating it like a function of the form $h(x)=f(x)/g(x)$? 
 Am I making a mistake thinking of it in this way? Because I am not able to reach the final formula of the pdf. Also, I am not able to find any paper where the derivation of $p_{opt}$ is worked out. 
 I would really appreciate your help.

"Question: 
 
 Given the distribution of the coloured balls in three different bags: 
  - Bag A: 1 Red 2 Black 2 Blue 
  - Bag B: 2 Red 4 Black 4 Blue 
  - Bag C: 10 Red 2 Black 3 Green 
 we carry out two independent experiments: 
  1) pick a bag, then pick a ball from the chosen bag. 
  2) pick a ball uniformly and random from all of the 30 balls. 
 We observe that the ball is red (for both experiment). 
  Now, we want to find  the posterior probability of ball was taken from bag C given the ball chosen is Red for each of the experiment  (i.e. P(Bag C | Red)). 
 
 My attempt: 
 For Experiment 1: 
Using Bayes Rule we have: 
P(Bag C | Red) = P(Bag C and Red) / P(Red) 
 From the distribution, we have P(BagC, Red) = 10/30
Now,P(Red)
= (by law of total probability) sum of conditional probability of
    P(Red | Bag X) * P(Bag X) 
= P(Red|BagC)*P(BagC) + P(Red|BagB)*P(BagB) + P(Red|BagA)*P(BagA)
= (1/3)(10/15) + (1/3)(2/10) + (1/3)(1/5) 
= 16/45

And hence P(BagC|Red) = (10/30) / (16/45) = 15/16 ???
 
 For Experiment 2: 
 this is the part where i am confuse, because intuitively, i dont not see the difference between both question! But i slept over it and think maybe the difference is in the way we calculate P(red), and thats why the following answer: 
 
So using the same formula above, but with difference calculation of the probability of getting a red ball from the bag: 
 P(Red) = total number of red / total number of balls = 13/30
Hence, P(BagC|Red) 
= P(Red, BagC) / P(Red) 
= (10/30) / (13/30) 
= 10/13
 
 Intuitively, i thought my answer made sense because if we were to choose a bag first, the probability of the red ball coming from bag C will be larger since the proportion of red balls in bag C is significantly higher.
 
In comparison, if we pick randomly from the pool of 30 balls, the contribution of C into the pool is higher as well (10/13 red balls from C).
 
I am not entirely sure if my approach is correct here, and would wish that you can validate my answers.

"I am working on a reduction of order problem and the last step is to solve what should be a simple first-order linear differential equation but frankly I'm not very good at them. 
 My problem started as:
\begin{equation}
  2tw'-3w = 0
\end{equation} 
 I recall that first order differential equations have the format
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d}w}{\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d}t} + p(t)w = g(t)
\end{equation}
Thus, I set $p(t)$ to $-3$, and calculate the integrating factor $u(t)$:
\begin{equation}
  e^{\int-3\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d}t} \implies e^{-3t}
\end{equation} 
 Multiplying the whole equation by the integrating factor, I get
\begin{equation}
  e^{-3t}2tw'-3e^{-3t}w = 0
\end{equation}
Now, this is close to what I remember from normal linear DQs in that I can reduce this to the product rule (I see a $e^{-3t}$ and a $-3e^{-3t}$), but there's just one problem... what do I do about the $2t$ mashed in the middle? 
 For reference, the answer turns out to be $w(t) = ct^{3/2}$; I do not know how to get from where I am to that.

"I never really understood how we use Big O to estimate algorithm efficiency.

But I can't understand what is the purpose of it and why does it makes sence. 
 Why do we even calculate it? It doesn't tell us neither exact number of steps in our algorithm nor even an approximate number of steps. I mean, suppose that our algorithm does  $10000000n^2 + 10^{1000}$  steps for the input of length  $n$ . We have  $O\left(n^2\right)$  in this case, but what does it tell us? You may say that ""with asymptotic notation you are trying to describe what will happen when the size  $\left(n\right)$  gets really really big"", BUT... if we wrote, for example,  $O\left(10000000n^2 + 10^{1000}\right)$  it would tell us the same and would be more informative. What makes us use  $O\left(n^2\right)$  instead?

So, why do we throw it away? Because it's not important? But who tells us what is important and what isn't?

"I am interested in solving problems which involve finding the number of real roots of any polynomial. 
 Suppose I take a function  $$f(x)=x^6+x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$$  This does not have any real roots but I am trying to figure out if there is some analytical way that does not involve graphing to come to this conclusion. 
 Using  Descartes' Rule of Signs ,
there are zero sign changes in  $f$  so by virtue of which there are no positive roots to the polynomial.
Considering  $$f(-x) = x^6-x^5+x^4-x^3+x^2-x+1$$  I concluded that there are either 6 negative, 4 negative, 2 negative or zero negative roots.
So I have 4 cases to consider : 
 
 0 positive roots, 6 negative roots, 0 complex roots 
 0 positive roots, 4 negative roots, 2 complex roots 
 0 positive roots, 2 negative roots, 4 complex roots 
 0 positive roots, 0 negative roots, 6 complex roots (The correct case) 
 
 I tried differentiating  $f$  but the derivative is equally bad  $$f'(x) = 6x^5+5x^4+4x^3+3x^2+2x+1$$  I am unable to conclude anything from this. 
 I tried going about the problem the other way. If a polynomial with an even degree is always positive or negative depending on the leading coefficient, it will not have any real roots but then again, finding the extrema of the function is proving to be extremely difficult.  
 I have tried using  Bolzano's Intermediate Value Theorem . It guarantees the existence of at least one root but then again, there is a possibility that there might be more than one which can only be eliminated by monotonicity which again brings me back to the bad derivative. 
 I believe there need to be some general rules by virtue of which, we are able to calculate the number of roots for any polynomial. 
 
 Is graphing the best technique for polynomials like these and if it is, are there any ways by which a quick but accurate plot can be drawn? 
 While reading about the relevant theory, I came across  Sturm's Method  and the  Newton-Raphson Method  but haven't touched these yet. Is it absolutely required to know these concepts to effectively draw conclusions?

 But is there a ""relatively simple"" exact closed form expression for the first $10-20$ values of $n$? Relatively simple meaning e.g. an expression for $P(n)$, $n \le$ ~$10-20$, that someone could calculate reasonably quickly on a basic calculator (products and sums okay, but e.g. no Bessel functions or something). Also, no approximate solutions, only exact solutions.

"I've been working on a question and it seems I have  obtained a paradoxical answer. Odds are I've just committed a mistake somewhere, however, I will elucidate the question and my solution just in case anyone is interested. 
 
 
 I want to know what is the average distance between two points on a circle of radius 1 where we consider only the boundary points. 
 
 My attempt is as follows:   
 Consider a segment of the diameter x which is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2. Then you can calculate the distance between the points (2,0) and the point determined by x just by elementary geometry as this picture shows: 
 
 Here in the picture, the green segment is the geometric mean and the orange one is the distance whose distribution we want to know.
Just by calculating the expected value, we obtain: 
 $E\left(\sqrt{(4-2X)}\right) = \int_{0}^{2} \sqrt{(4-2x)}\cdot\frac{1}{2} dx = 1.333.... = \frac{4}{3}$   
 Where  $\sqrt{(4-2x)}$  is the transformation of the random variable and  $\frac{1}{2}$  is the pdf of a uniform distribution  $[0,2]$ .  
 Also, if we derive the pdf of the transformation we obtain the same result: 
 $y = \sqrt{(4-2x)} , x = 2- \frac{y^2}{2}, \mid\frac{d}{dy}x\mid = y$ 
 $g(y)=f(x)\cdot\mid\frac{d}{dy}x\mid = \frac{1}{2}\cdot y$ 
 $E(Y)= \int_{0}^{2}y\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot y dy = 1.333.... = \frac{4}{3} $ 
 I have seen a different approach somewhere else where the distribution of the angle is considered as a uniform distribution between 0 and  $\pi$  and the final result was: 
 $1.27... = \frac{4}{\pi}$ 
 That's pretty much the problem I found. Maybe I just did it wrong in some step but it all makes sense to me. I know this is not exactly what we refer as Bertrand paradox but it just suggests something like that because both problems handle with segments in circumference and maybe my result is wrong because it does not hold for rotations of the circle or something like that (I read a little bit about the Bertrand's Paradox). 
 
 That's pretty much it. Also sorry for my bad English and maybe I'm also wrong in something pretty elemental since I've just started learning about probability theory. It's also my first post so I will try to improve my exposition and LateX use in the following ones.

 I tried the squeeze theorem, and I can see that $L \in [\frac{1}{2},1]$.  
 I found the solution, as $$L=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+i}}}$$
$$L=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n{\frac{1}{{n}\sqrt{1+\frac{i}{n}}}}$$ 
 We can look at the limit as a way to calculate the area of a function of reals, so we have $$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x}}$$
$$L=\int_{0}^1f(x)=...=2(\sqrt2-1)$$ 
 Is there a way to do it without integration? Another way, a better way? 
 Second part of the question: 
 Trying another way of finding solution, I made a mistake that shows lack of fundamental understanding:  
 $$L=\lim_{n \to \infty}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+2}}+...+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+n}}) $$ 
 Now we take $ln$ of both sides: 
 $$\ln{L}=\ln\lim_{n \to \infty}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+2}}+...+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+n}}) $$ 
 $$\ln{L}=\lim_{n \to \infty}(\ln\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1}}+\ln\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+2}}+...+\ln\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+n}}) $$ 
 $$\ln{L}=-\lim_{n \to \infty}(\ln({\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1}})+\ln({\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+2}})+...+\ln({\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+n}})) $$ 
 $$\ln{L}=-\lim_{n \to \infty}(\ln({\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+1}})+\ln({\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+2}})+...+\ln({\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n+n}})) $$ 
 $$\ln{L}=-\lim_{n \to \infty}\ln{\sqrt{{(n^n)\prod_{i=1}^n(n+i)}}}$$

EDIT: Calculate  $\dim(W)$ . by finding a basis for W. 
 We need to find a basis for W the easiest way to do this is to look for as many linearly independent vectors as we can, we start by writing down the equations  we get  $ ax^3 + bx^2 + cx +d =0$  and  $ 3ax^2 + 2bx +c =0$  where  $ x=1$  in the first equation and  $x=2$  in the second this is from  $f(1)=f^{'}(2)=0$  we get

    0      & b & \frac{11c}{8} & \frac{3d}{2}&  &0 
\end{bmatrix} $ 
 Now here i am a bit lost we can solve for a and b in terms of c and d but we cant actually find a value for anything. I do have a theorem that tells me that this spans my subspace W but it doesn't tell me that my two vectors are linearly independent, in fact I don't even really have 2 vectors I got infinitely many of them in some sense, I tried writing out  $$c_1(ax^3 -\frac{3c}{8} x -\frac{d}{2})+c_2 (bx^2 +\frac{11c}{8}x+\frac{3d}{2})=0$$  but i just have too many variables to say that  $c_1=c_2=0$  is the only solution. Normally i would just guess some values but my prof said we apparently are not able to do that and assume what we found was spanning but I don't see anywhere to go from here. Can someone give me a hint how to proceed? 
 We are going to need a and b to be nonzero for this to make any sense so lets pick  $a=b=1$  we know by theorem that what we have is spanning but must show linearly independent.
we have that  $1= \frac{3c}{8} +\frac{d}{2}$  and  $1= -\frac{11c}{8} -\frac{3d}{2}$  this tells us that  $1+3 =  -\frac{11c}{8}+\frac{9c}{8} -\frac{3d}{2} + \frac{3d}{2}$  or  $4=-\frac{2c}{8}$  or  $c=-16$  and  $d = (1+6)2=14$ .\  We now wish to show that
 $c_1 ( x^3 +6x -7) +c_2 (x^2 -22x +21) =0 $  if and only if  $c_1=c_2=0$ .  $ c_1 x^3 +c_2 x^2 + x(6c_1-22c_2) -7c_1 +21c_2 =0$  for this to be true for all x this tells us that  $ -7c_1 +21c_2 =0$  or  $ c_1 =3c_2$  Now we have that   $ 3c_2 x^3 +c_2 x^2 + x(18c_2-22c_2) -21c_2 +21c_2 =0$   but this tells us that  $-4c_2 =0$  so we have that  $c_2=0 $  but from this we know that  $c_1=0$ . This tells us that the vector  $( x^3 +6x -7)$  and the vector  $(x^2 -22x +21) $  are linearly independent. However, we know that they span our subspace W as well so they form a basis for W.

"Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be Bernoulli distributed with parameter $p$. We define $\overline X = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1} X_i$ and consider a point estimate $T=\overline X(1- \overline X)$. I want to compute if the estimator is biased or equivalent, if $\mathbb{E}[T]=\sigma^2$. I computed this two different ways, with two different results: 
 Firstly : $\mathbb{E}[T]=\mathbb{E}[\overline X - \overline X^2]=\mathbb{E}[\overline X]-\mathbb{E}[\overline X^2]$. 
 For $\mathbb{E}[\overline X]$ is used the linearity of the mean value operator and that the expectation of a single Bernoulli variable is $p$. I then get $\mathbb{E}[\overline X]=\frac{1}{n}np=p$. For $\mathbb{E}[\overline X^2]$ I used that $\overline X \approx \frac{1}{n} \operatorname{Bin}(n,p)$ and looked up the second moment which is $n^2p^2+np(1-p)$. The first way would then yield
$\mathbb{E}[T]=\mathbb{E}[\overline X]-\mathbb{E}[\overline X^2]=p - \frac{1}{n^2}(n^2p^2+np(1-p))=p[(1-p)(1-\frac{1}{n})]$. Thus, the estimator is biased. 
 Secondly : I tried to calculate $\mathbb{E}[\overline X^2]$ in another way. I used that for each $X_i\approx \operatorname{Bernoulli}(p)$ the second moment is given by $\mathbb{E}[X_i^2]=p\cdot 1 + (1-p)\cdot 0=p$ and then used that 
$\mathbb{E}[\overline X^2]=\frac{1}{n^2}\mathbb{E}[\sum_{i,j=1}^nX_iX_j]=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^{n^2} \mathbb{E}[X_i^2]=\frac{1}{n^2}n^2p=p$ which is obviously different from my frist method.

"Suppose you have 2 fair decks, let's call them deck A and deck B. Now take two cards from deck A and add them to the deck B, and shuffle; thus you now have a deck with 54 cards. Now draw 2 cards from deck B, what's the probability that you draw an ace? 
 EDIT: Let's say you draw exactly 1 ace. 
 This is kind of an arbitrary question I made up, I don't care so much about the specific answer but about the process. I'm really trying to understand conditional probability and I feel like if I can answer a question like this I'll be on my way. 
 My guess is that first we calculate the odds that one or both of the cards from deck A were aces. Then you would weigh the possibilities of two aces having been transferred, one ace having been transferred, or no aces having been transfered across drawing from deck B? 
 Can someone point me in the right direction? 
 Also as a complete aside, how do you calculate the odds of drawing exactly one ace when drawing two cards from a deck of 52? I've answered the question using complelemntary probability of drawing 2 aces, and no aces and then subtracting that from 1 but is there a ""direct"" way of doing it? i feel that I understand better when it's not through complements

"For example, imagine an object that consists to equal parts of two substances with the following half-lifes: 
 
 $t_{1, 1/2} = 1d$ 
 $t_{2, 1/2} = 1000d$ 
 
 I would now like to find out the time after the object has decayed by half. For this I have this formula:
 $$
N(t) = \frac{2^{-\frac{t}{t_{1,1/2}}} + 2^{-\frac{t}{t_{2,1/2}}}}{2} = 1/2
$$ 
 Unfortunately, rearranging according to  $t$  is not possible, because  $log_2(a+b) \neq log_2(a) + log_2(b)$ . 
 Therefore, the only thing that has occurred to me so far is to use this method to calculate the time (code in python): 
 def average(halfLifes, t):
    sum = 0.0
    for halfLife in halfLifes:
        sum += pow(2, -t / halfLife)

    return sum / len(halfLifes);

t = 0
halfLifes = [1, 1000]
stepSize = 4
error = 1

while error > 0.0001:
    y = average(halfLifes, t)
    if y < 0.5:
        t -= stepSize
        stepSize /= 2
        t += stepSize
    else:
        t += stepSize
    error = abs(y - 0.5)

print(""t: "" + str(t))
print(""y: "" + str(average(halfLifes, t)))
 
 This gives the result  $t \approx 7.625d$ . Unfortunately, the calculation is very slow and for example with 20000 values, the calculation already takes ~9 seconds. 
 Is there a way to make this faster or to solve this mathematically better? It is not important that the solution is accurate.

 1 +  1 / 2  +  1 / 3  +  1 / 4  +  1 / 5  +  1 / 6  + ... +  1 / n  + ...  
 
 It is known that this sum  diverges , meaning (informally) that the sum is infinite and (more formally) that for any real number x, there there is some number n such t that the sum of the first n terms of the harmonic series is greater than x.  For example, given x = 3, we have that 
 
 1 +  1 / 2  +  1 / 3  + ... +  1 / 11  =  83711 / 27720  ≈ 3.02 
 
 So eleven terms must be summed together to exceed 3. 
 Consider the following question 
 
 Given an integer x, find the smallest value of n such that the sum of the first n terms of the harmonic series exceeds x. 
 
 Clearly we can compute this by just adding in more and more terms of the harmonic series, but this seems like it could be painfully slow.  The best bound I'm aware of on the number of terms necessary is 2 O(n) , which uses the fact that 
 
 1 +  1 / 2  +  1 / 3  +  1 / 4  +  1 / 5  +  1 / 6  +  1 / 7  +  1 / 8  + ...

 which is in turn 
 
 1 +  1 / 2  +  1 / 2  +  1 / 2  + ... 
 
 where each new  1 / 2  takes twice as many terms as the previous to accrue.  This means that the brute-force solution is likely to be completely infeasible for any reasonably large choice of x. 
 Is there way to calculate the harmonic series which requires less operations than the brute-force solution?

 We're given a sender and a receiver. The sender sends ""words"" from the set  $ W = \{00, 01, 10, 11\}$ . For a word  $v \in W$ , the event  $S_v$  describes the word  $v$  being sent and the event  $R_v$  is the event that  $v$  is received. It is given that  $P(S_{00}) = 0.9, P(S_{01}) = 0.06, $   $ P(S_{10}) = 0.03,$   $ P(S_{11}) = 0.01$ . Transmission errors can also occur, these are given by:

"I play a game called DragonSky merge and idle (or something like this). The basic premise of the early game is that dragons will spawn, and will be fused in pairs. You continue to fuse these until you have a level  $10$  dragon. 
 Let me be precise. Let  $\{D_1,D_2,\dots, D_{10}\}$  denote the set of types of dragons. Then, the following occurs: 
 
 Every  $.9$  seconds a dragon will spawn of type  $D_1$  with probability  $.8$ , and of type  $D_2$  with probability  $.2$ . 
 For each  $i\in\Bbb N$  such that  $1\leq i\leq 8$ , two dragons of type  $D_i$  will be fused to form a dragon of type  $D_{i+1}$  with probability  $P_1=.85$  or a dragon of type  $D_{i+2}$  with probability  $P_2=.15$ . For  $i=9$ , they will always fuse to a dragon of type  $D_{10}$ . This merging will occur until there is no pair of dragons of the same type. 
 
 These two steps will continuously repeat.  As a small example  of  $6$  time steps, let us denote a collection of  $k$  dragons of type  $D_i$  by  $d_{i}^1,\dots,d_i^k$  (of course, after fusion  $k\in\{0,1\}$ ). Then we could have the following sequence of sets of dragons, where  $\overset{1}{\to}$  means rule  $1$  was applied (a dragon spawned), and  $\overset{2}{\to}$  means rule  $2$  was applied (a pair of dragons was fused).
 $$\emptyset\overset{1}{\to}\{d_1^1\}\overset{1}{\to}\{d_1^1,d_1^2\}\overset{2}{\to}\{d_2^1\}\overset{1}{\to}\{d_2^1,d_2^2\}\overset{2}{\to}\{d_3^1\}\overset{1}{\to}\{d_2^1,d_3^1\}\overset{1}{\to}\{d_1^1,d_2^1,d_3^1\}\overset{1}{\to}\{d_1^1,d_1^2,d_2^1,d_3^1\}\overset{2}{\to}\{d_2^1,d_2^2,d_3^1\}\overset{2}{\to}\{d_3^1,d_3^2\}\overset{2}{\to}\{d_4^1\},$$ 
(This sequence might fully exhibit the behaviour I describe, noting that there are two steps where a  $D_2$  was spawned, and  $4$  where a  $D_1$  was spawned.) 
 I am trying to determine the number of seconds it takes on average to form a dragon of type  $D_{10}$  assuming that we initially start with no dragons. I have very little experience with probability theory, so my first approach was to simplify this by taking  $P_1=1$  and  $P_2=0$ , but what I compute is definitely not correct. My approach there was to consider:
 $$E_n = \{(x,y)\mid x+y=n, x+2y\geq 2^{10}, x,y\in\Bbb Z_{\geq 0}\},$$ 
where  $(x,y)\in E_n$  corresponds to a valid sequence of  $n$  spawns that yields a  $D_{10}$  dragon, such that there were  $x$  spawns of  $D_1$  and  $y$  spawns of  $D_2$ . Then I thought I would only need to take  $$S_n=\sum_{(x,y)\in E_n}(.2)^i,$$ 
for the probability that we have a  $D_{10}$  in precisely  $n$  steps, and I am then looking for  $k$  such that
 $$\sum_{i=1}^k S_i\approx .5.$$ 
This led me to make a mistake (after many calculations), and also doesn't deal with the proper fusion rates. 
 A second thought I had would be to set this up in terms of Markov chains, where we simply enumerate all possible sequences  $(n_1^t,\dots,n_{10}^t)$  of numbers of dragons  $n_i^t$  of type  $D_i$  at time step  $t$ , and edges corresponding to merging and spawning, but I had trouble setting this up precisely, and even doing so, it seemed that I (personally) can't calculate the resulting probability .

The first group will randomly choose 40 people to survey, and the second group will randomly choose 40 people to survey, and so on. Each group will choose independently of each other. There are 16 total groups, with 14 of them choosing 40 people, 1 of them choosing 50 people, and 1 of them choosing 60 people.  
 Questions: Can this situation be related to an existing and well-studied type of problem? What is the average amount of surveys each individual will get? What is the standard deviation? What is the expected (average) amount of people that receives 0, 1, 2, 3...16 surveys?  If we suspect some groups did not carry out the amount of surveys they are supposed to (e.g. all groups only did a-half of the surveys they claimed to) and so we collected a sample in the population, what should we find in order to conclude that some groups did not survey the amount they claimed.   
 I found some of these questions quite simple, while some are quite complicated.  
 The mean is easily solvable: $\frac{40*14+50+60}{223}$

 It became quite apparent that the number of cases grow at a fast rate (perhaps an exponential growth), so I wrote a program that did the calculations. Unfortunately, though I tried to perform multiple optimizations, including ignoring cases that has a low probability of occurring and tracking only people that received 0 and 1 surveys, the calculation still took half an hour. The result is: 
 Expected values:  
 People with 0 surveys: 7.94284 
 People with 1 survey: 29.52534 
 People with 2 surveys and above: 185.53182 
 When I try to increase the amount of surveys counted, it seems to take forever when calculating group 8 or so. The brute-force method of finding every case (or, with optimizations, probable cases), therefore, failed to get an answer due to the amount of calculations needed. But, I found out that the expected values displayed a pattern. Though I have no ironclad proof, for smaller testing samples, the pattern matches the brute-force method perfectly. Here is an example.  
 
 Selecting from a population of 8. The expected (average) amount of people getting n surveys after selecting m people = (amount of people getting n surveys before this selection) * [(n-m) / n)] + (amount of people getting n - 1 surveys before this selection) * (m / n). In other words, expected survey count = amount of people remaining in this count due to not getting selected + amount of people promoted from (count - 1) due to getting selected.  
 The computation is still quite tedious, so I wrote a program and an Excel spreadsheet that calculates it. The formula is shown on the top of the picture.  
 
 The program is more flexible and have more options in accuracy, so here is the rounded result of the program.  
 Mean: 3.0044843049 
 Standard Deviation: 2.4423302226 
 Expected surveys received: 
 0 surveys: 7.9428 people 
 1 survey: 29.525 people 
 2 surveys: 51.350 people 
 3 surveys: 55.471 people 
 4 surveys: 41.663 
 5 surveys: 23.072 
 6 surveys: 9.7455 
 7 surveys: 3.2032 
 8 surveys: 0.82802 
 9 surveys: 0.16891 
 10 surveys: 0.027101 
 11 surveys: 0.0033846 
 12 surveys: 0.00032254 
 13 surveys: 0.000022674 
 14 surveys: 0.0000011090 
 15 surveys: 3.3720E-8 
 16 surveys: 4.8016E-10 
 Now answering the fifth question (suspecting groups making less surveys than claimed), according to the Central Limit Theorem, the mean of the sample distribution is equal to the mean of the population, and the standard deviation is $\sigma_\bar{x} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. So after the sample is taken (not violating the 10% rule), we can plug the value of n in an see if the sample mean is 2$\sigma$ away from the expected mean. If it is more than 2$\sigma$ away, we have sufficient reason to doubt the integrity of the sampling groups. We can probably also look at whether the sample survey counts match the population expected survey counts, but I don't know how this comparison can lead to any conclusion.  
 So, my final questions now became: 
 
 Can this situation be related to any existing problems that are well-studied?  
 Are all my calculations and methodologies correct? Especially, is the formula for making inferences about expected count correct? If so, what is the proof?  
 Are there any formula that can calculate the expected survey counts faster?  
 Can I infer anything from the comparison between expected survey counts and sample survey counts?  
 
 I apologize for the long description, but that's what I've got so far and I am quite curious about this problem.

 (important details) I need to show that the following matrix is positive definite for  $\epsilon >0 , \eta >0$  (both sufficiently small): 
 $$\begin{bmatrix} 2\left(\dfrac{1}{\epsilon} + \eta\right) &  2\left(\dfrac{1}{\epsilon} + \eta\right) -1 & 1 - 4 \eta \\

I believe this matrix has a very special structure. Is it easy to see the positive definiteness? Or, do I really need to calculate the determinant of this 3-by-3 matrix? 
 Interesting edit:  
When we solve a problem like  $\min \{f(x)= -x_1x_2 : \ g(x) = x_1+x_2 - 2=0  \}$  then the exact augmented Lagrangian function:
 $$ 
S(x,\lambda) = f(x) + \lambda^\top g(x) + \frac{1}{\epsilon}\|g(x)\|^2 + \eta \left\| \frac{\partial g(x)}{\partial x}  \nabla_x L(x,\lambda)\right\|^2
$$ 
has first order condition results  $x_1,x_2,\lambda = 1$ , same with the original optimal solution. This FOC's do not depend on  $\epsilon, \eta >0$ . So, in such a simple problem there is no need to solve for  any   $\eta , \epsilon$ . We can just fix some  $\epsilon, \eta$  values such that the Hessian of  $S(x,\lambda)$  is p.d., hence  $S$  is convex, hence minimizing  $S$  gives the same value as solving the original problem. In this case, fixing  $\epsilon, \eta = 1$  is enough.

"Let  $A$ ,  $B$  and  $C$  be symmetric, positive semi-definite matrices. Is it true that
 $$ \|(A + C)^{1/2} - (B + C)^{1/2}\| \leq \|A^{1/2} - B^{1/2}\|,$$ 
in either the 2 or Frobenius norm?  
 It is clearly true when  $A, B$  and  $C$  commute, but the general case is less clear to me. In fact, even the particular case  $B = 0$  does not seem obvious. 
 
 Without loss of generality, it is clear that we can assume that  $C$  is diagonal.
We show that it is sufficient to prove to prove the inequality for the matrix with zeros everywhere except on any position  $k$  on the diagonal,
 $$
(C_k)_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } i=j=k\\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$ 
Clearly,  if the inequality is true for one  $C_k$ , it is true for any  $C_k$ , by flipping the axes, and also for  $C = \alpha C_k$ , for any  $\alpha \geq 0$ , because
 \begin{align}
\|(A + \alpha \, C_k)^{1/2} - (B + \alpha C_k)^{1/2}\| 
&= \sqrt{\alpha} \|(A/\alpha +  C_k)^{1/2} - (B/\alpha + C_k)^{1/2}\|  \\
&\leq \sqrt{\alpha} \|(A/\alpha)^{1/2} - (B/\alpha)^{1/2}\|
= \sqrt{\alpha} \|A^{1/2} - B^{1/2}\|
\end{align} 
Now, a general diagonal  $C$  can be decomposed as  $C = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k C_k$ .
Applying the previous inequality (specialized for a matrix  $C$  with only one nonzero diagonal element) repeatedly,
we can remove the diagonal elements one by one
 \begin{align}
&\|(A + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2} - (B + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2}\| \\
&\qquad = \|((A + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\alpha_k \, C_k) + \alpha_n C_n)^{1/2} - ((B + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\alpha_k \, C_k) + \alpha_n C_n)^{1/2}\| \\
&\qquad \leq \|(A + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2} - (B + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2}\| \\
&\qquad \leq \|(A + \sum_{k=1}^{n-2}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2} - (B + \sum_{k=1}^{n-2}\alpha_k \, C_k)^{1/2}\| \\
&\qquad \leq \dots \leq \sqrt{\alpha} \|A^{1/2} - B^{1/2}\|.
\end{align} 
 
 Here are three ways of proving the inequality in 1 dimension,
which I tried to generalize to the multidimensional case without success.
Let us write  $a$ ,  $b$ ,  $c$  instead of  $A$ ,  $B$ ,  $C$ ,
to emphasize that we are working in one dimension,
and let us assume without loss of generality that  $a \leq b$ . 
 
 Let us write:
 $$ f(c) = \sqrt{b + c} - \sqrt{a + c} $$ 
We calculate that the derivative of  $f$  is given by
 $$
f'(c) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{b + c}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{a + c}} \right) \leq 0,
$$ 
and so  $f(c) = f(0) + \int_{0}^{c} f'(x) \, d x  \leq f(0)$ . 
 We have, by the fundamental theorem of calculus and a change of variable
 \begin{align}
    \sqrt{b + c} - \sqrt{a + c} &= \int_{a + c}^{b + c} \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x}} \, d x = \int_{a}^{b} \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x + c}} \, d x  \\
    &\leq \int_{a}^{b} \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x}} \, d x = \sqrt{b} - \sqrt{a}.
\end{align} 
 Squaring the two sides of the inequality, we obtain
 $$
a + c - 2 \sqrt{a+ c} \, \sqrt{b + c} + b + c \leq a + b - 2 \sqrt{a} \sqrt{b}.
$$ 
Simplifying and rearranging,
 $$
c + \sqrt{a} \sqrt{b} \leq \sqrt{a+ c} \, \sqrt{b + c} .
$$ 
Squaring again
 $$
\require{cancel} \cancel{c^2 + a b} + 2 c \sqrt{a b} \leq \cancel{c^2 + ab} + ac + bc,
$$ 
leading to
 $$ a  + b - 2 \sqrt{ab} = (\sqrt{b} - \sqrt{a})^2 \geq 0$$ . 
 
 Numerical experiments suggest that the inequality is true in both the 2 and the Frobenius norm.

What is the formula for the shape swept by the circle in a given amount of time N? 
 It occurs to me that there are two cases. First, when  s <= b , the motion of the circle is overshadowed by the expansion, and the final shape ends up being a circle at (0,  s N ) with radius  r+b N . 
 
 But when  s > b , the expansion can't keep up with the motion, and it sweeps a shape through space. It appears to me that the exact shape is that of both circles connected by line segments tangent to both, like two pulleys with a belt.

 So,  $\text{P}(X=x)=5/10=.5$  for either  $x=1$  or  $x=0$ . After doing this I want to figure out  $\text{P}(X=x,Y=y)$  for each possible value of both  $x,y$ . I think my sample space looks something like this
 $$\Omega = \text { \{ (w,w,w),(w,w,b),(w,b,w),(b,w,w),(b,b,b),(b,b,w),(b,w,b),(w,b,b) \} }$$  where b stands for black marble, and w for white marble and their positions tells me order in which they were extracted. 
 $\textbf{My issue:}$  Is how to calculate any one of those probabilities, for example  $\text{P(w,w,w)}$ , since trying to calculate  $ \begin{align}
&\begin{aligned} 
\text{P}(Y=0,X=1)=\text{P}(\text{0 black marbles extracted and 1st extracted marble is white}) = \text{P}(\text{Extracting 3 white marbles}) = \text{P(w,w,w)}.
\end{aligned}
\end{align}
$ 
 Since there is no replacement there is no independence and I cannot make  $\text{P(w,w,w)}=\text{P(w)P(w)P(w)}$  and I doubt the answer is  $\frac{1}{8}$  since if I change the initial conditions to one million white marbles essentially my model would remain the same but clearly the probability of drawing 3 white marbles would increasy drastically. 
 Any insights or hints are much appreciated!

"I am having trouble understanding what should be extremely simple. I am comfortable with the more algebraic definition of a differential form as in Bott and Tu as the tensor product of the algebra of smooth functions on $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and the anti-symmetric tensor algebra as in,
\begin{equation}
\label{algebraicdefinition}
\mathbb{C}^{\infty} \left( U \right) \otimes \bigwedge E \tag{1}
\end{equation}
where $E$ has a basis $dx_{i}$. My confusion is in relating this to the definition in terms of a map from $U$ to the algebra of alternating functions. Let's specialize to the case of a $2$-form for now. I am given the definition of a differential form $\omega$ as a smooth map
$$ \omega: U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n} \to Alt^{2}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n} \right) $$
Now in terms of $\eqref{algebraicdefinition}$, this might look like
$$ \left( x^{2} + y^{2} + 3xyz \right)dx \wedge dy  $$
for example.  So say I take the case $n=3$ and consider $\left( a, b, c \right) \in U$ and so evaluating $\omega$ there gives, say
$$ \omega_{\left(a, b, c \right)} = \left(a^{2} + b^{2} + 3abc \right)dx \wedge dy.$$
My question is, how is this an alternating function on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$? If took a concrete example and took two elements of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, say, $u = (1,2)$ and $v=(3,4)$, how would I actually calculate the value of $\omega_{\left(a, b, c \right)}\left( u, v \right)$? 
 I realize this is an extremely simple question, but I am finding the literature on differential forms very unhelpful. I'm still not entirely sure what ""$dx$"" actually is as a mathematical object.  
 Any help would be appreciated.

"This is the exercise 6.1.5 in Weibel's book. 
 
 Let $G$ be any group and $A$ be a trivial $G$-module. Show that $H^1(G;A)\cong\hom(G,A)\cong\hom(G/[G,G],A)$ 
 
 In the book, $H^*(G;A)$ is defined to be the right derived functor of the fixed-point functor $(-)^G$, which is naturally isomorphic to $Ext_{\mathbb{Z}G}^*(\mathbb{Z},A)$. 
 I know there are many ways to calculate this cohomology. For example, one can use the bar resolution of $\mathbb{Z}$ or crossed homomorphism. 
 However, this exercise is posed right after the calculation of $H_1(G;A)\cong G/[G,G]$ for any trivial $G$-module $A$. Besides, the author hasn't introduced any explicit resolution for $\mathbb{Z}$ or crossed homomorphisms, or any other useful machinary. Therefore, I am wondering if there is some slick calculation taking advantages of the triviality of $A$ and the result of $H_1(G;A)$. 
 Thank you. 
 EDIT: 
 By ""slick calculation"", i really meant a calculation using just the knowledge introduced before this exercise in the book. I've already known there are many ways to calculate it. However, the author  didn't introduce other machinery but stated this exercise anyway. Therefore, I guess I am supposed to be able to calculate it just using what I've learnt so far.

 Question:   
 
 I flip a fair coin independently 6 times. This gives me a sequence of heads and tails. For each consecutive 'HTH' in the sequence you win $5.  
 So I define a random variable X to be the amount of dollars that I win. For example here is what $X=5$ is: $THTHTT$, and $X=10$ is: $THTHTH$. What is the best way to calculate the expected value of X? 
 
 Accepted Answer: 
 
 We use the method of  indicator random variables , and solve the problem for $n$ tosses. For $k=3$ to $n$, let random variable $X_k$ be $1$ if there is an HTH sequence ending at the $k$-th toss, and let $X_k=0$ otherwise. Then the amount $W$ that we win is given by 
  $$W=5(X_3+X_4+\cdots +X_n).$$
  By the linearity of expectation we have
  $$E(W)=5E(X_3)+5E(X_4)+\cdots+5E(X_n).$$
  We have $E(X_i)=\Pr(X_i=1)=\frac{1}{8}$, so $E(W)=\dfrac{5(n-2)}{8}$. 
 Only minor modification is needed for a biased coin that has probability $p$ of landing heads.

 This user has stated on his profile that he cannot answer questions about past posts:  
 I am wondering why $Pr(X_i=1) = 1/8$ ? Since there are $6$ coin flips, there are $2^6$ possible outcomes. Did he calculate every single way there can be a sequence of $HTH$ and divided by $2^6$ to get $1/8$ or is there an easier way? I believe there is an easier, more intuitive way, but I don't know how.  
 What if I decided I wanted my indicator random variable to be $1$ if $X_i, X_{i+1}, X_{i+2}$ creates the sequence $HTH$ respectively ($k = 1$ to $4$ inclusive)?

"This problem stems from a British Standard for staircases, of all things (BS 5395-1 2010, diagram B4 p.27), which prescribes the position of stairs when they turn a corner. I've tried to find an easy way to calculate the positions rather than use ""pen and paper"", but because it's based on ellipses, I can't find a way to create a good calculation method for it. I've abstracted the ""real world"" problem and would like ideas how best to approach it. 
 Definitions: 
 
 P1, P2 and P3 are three arbitrary points not in a straight line; (x1,y1) are the co-ordinates of P1; L1 and L2 are the line segments P1-P3 and P2-P3. 
 e  is an ellipse drawn tangent to L1 at P1 and tangent to L2 at P2. 
 k is an arbitrary parameter required to fix one specific ellipse  e  out of the many ellipses that could be drawn - needed because the original problem only specifies 4 constraints for an ellipse, and an ellipse needs 5. 
 G is a number > 0 that is ""small-ish"" compared to the distance between P1 and P2 (in the real world problem G would be about 20% to 50% of the distance between P1 and P2). This condition ensures that the intersection (x2,y2) described below actually exists, and that the problem isn't pathological or degenerate. 
 
 The problem is to determine formulaically - ie not using approximations - the points (x1,y1) (x2,y2) etc constructed by this algorithm: 
 
 Draw the points P1, P2, P3 and the line segments L1, L2. 
 
 Draw an ellipse  e  that is tangent to L1 at P1 and tangent to L2 at P2. Because there may be an infinity of such ellipses (4 constraints, 5 required), this step requires us to create some convenient way to parameterise the problem with a 5th parameter ""k"" which can be varied to choose one unique ellipse out of all possible tangential ellipses for a given {P1, P2, P3}. 
 
 Draw a circle radius G centre P1. Because of the ""small-ish"" limit on G, this circle will intersect the ellipse  e  at some point of its arc between P1 and P2. Call this point (x2,y2). 
 
 Continue repeating step 3, at each iteration drawing a circle radius G centre (x(n),y(n)) and call the next intersection with the ellipse  e , (x(n+1),y(n+1)), then a circle centre (x(n+1), y(n+1)) with intersection (x(n+2),y(n+2)), etc. Stop when we would go past P2. In the ""real world"" problem we will have constructed no more than 4, perhaps 5 points (x2,y2) through (x4 or x5, y4 or y5). 
 
 
 
 The ""stop at P2"" constraint means our solution doesn't need to consider any intersections on the ""return arc"" of the ellipse;  and the smallness of G means that our circle at (say) (x3,y3) must always intersect the ellipse  e  at just two points: (x2,y2) which we already know, and (x4,y4) which is the point we want - it can't touch the ""far side"" of the ellipse or fail to touch it at all. 
 
 The problem is to pick a convenient parameterisation method (""k"") and then, given arbitrary P1, p2, P3, G, k, determine the co-ordinates of all (xn,yn). I'd like to avoid ""brute force"" methods such as approximation techniques but I can't see how.  Is there a ""sensible"" way to do this algebraically? How might I go about it? 
 Diagram for this problem 
 Update 1: 
 I solved the first part (I think) by using a property of tangents to an ellipse, namely that lines from either focus of an ellipse to a point on its perimeter, will make a constant angle with the tangent at that point. Switching that around, if I  choose  0 <= α < 90 as an arbitrary angle, then a line at α to the tangent must pass through a focus of the ellipse, from both P1 and P2. I can therefore find my unique ellipse, which is the first part of the problem, this way: 
 
 Construct the normals N1 and N2, passing through P1 and P2 (easy, as I have the direction of the tangents at both points). 
 
 Pick an arbitrary angle 0 <= α < 90. This will be my parameter ""k"" above, the 5th parameter needed to identify a unique ellipse among all possible solutions. 
 
 Rotate both normals around their respective points by (α). That is, rotate N1 using centre P1 and rotation = α, and rotate N2 using centre P2 and rotation = α. Identify the point these intersect as F1. 
 
 Do the same again, but this time rotating both normal by (-α). Again the normals will intersect and call this point F2. 
 
 The unique ellipse for (P1, P2, L1, L2, α) is an ellipse with foci (F1) and (F2). Its eccentricity can be found by usual ellipse properties as we know both foci and a point on the perimeter (ie the distance F1-P1-F2 etc). Its axes can be found by constructing the line F1-F2 and its bisector, and so on. 
 
 
 
 Note, I used the normal not the tangent because then the foci are at +/- α, not α and (180-α), which is simpler :) 
 Also, the family of solutions can be found by varying α, and I think that this must generate all solutions since any ellipse that is a solution must by definition have lines from its foci to P1 and P2 that are at some identical angle (α) to L1 and L2. 
 
 Now just to solve the intersection of the circles and the ellipses. 
 So far, is this correct? Is this necessary, or n & sufficient?

"cenario: You have marbles of 2 colors, red and blue. You put one red and one blue marble in a bag and take one at random. The probability of getting a red marble is obviously 50%. But then you add 5 more blue marbles in the bag and take one at random again. The probability of getting red for that attempt alone is obviously 1/7, but how do I calculate the overall probability of getting a red marble at least once through both attempts whereas each attempt has a different probability?

 Attempt 2: 7 marbles, 2 red, 5 blue

"Here's a question one of my precalculus students asked me, paraphrased for clarity: 
 
 You know how if you have the line  $y=x$ , and you want to reflect the graph of a function  $f(x)$  across it, you can just switch the  $y$  and  $x$  in the equation of the function (since you're just finding  $f^{-1}$  if it exists). What if you wanted to reflect a graph about something like  $y=2x$  instead? Or  $y=2x-3$ ? Is there some trick analogous to ""switch the  $x$  and the  $y$ "" to find the equation of this reflected curve? 
 
 My trouble is that I don't have an explanation that would be particularly good for a precalulus student. Is there an elegant way to explain to a precalculus student how to do this that looks analogous to the ""switch  $x$  and  $y$ "" trick? Here are the approaches to reflecting a curve about a line that I know, that I think are a bit too heavy for this student. 
 
 Do some vector-calculus looking stuff: To reflect the graph of  $f$  across  $y=mx+b$ , you translate the  $y$  values by  $b$  to make the line go through the origin, look at the projection of a point on the translated graph onto the normal vector  $\langle -m,1 \rangle$  of the line, use the projection to reflect the graph, then translate back by  $-b$ . I can calculate this for the student, but I don't think the formula will look memorable, and certainly won't be a clean ""trick."" Right now I'm leaning towards showing the student a nice picture of this without any calculations. I'll probably type this up in detail as an answer sometime unless someone has a better suggestion. 
 Talk about  reflection matrices : a reflection about a line in the  $xy$ -plane with an angle of  $\theta$  with the  $x$ -axis is given by multiplication by the matrix  $$\begin{pmatrix}\cos2\theta&\sin2\theta\\\sin2\theta&-\cos2\theta\end{pmatrix}\,,$$  then the case where  $\theta = \pi/4$ , where you're reflecting about the line  $y=x$ , corresponds to the matrix 
 $$\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}\,,$$ 
which just switches the  $x$  and the  $y$  coordinates of the graph. But then introducing matrices as linear transformations, and explaining why  that  matrix corresponds to reflections, would be tough.

 The problem is relevant in the cable design industry. The first step is to define the diameter of a circle and its numerosity  n : from that I calculate the diameter of a  supercicle  that contains  n  tangent circles. To calculate that I cheated a little bit: I used a factor called ""lay up factor"" (that factor it's defined in an international ISO norm), so for instance if I have  $3$  circles of diameter  d  the diameter  s  of the  supercircle  will be  $2.13*d$ . After that I have to calculate the diameter of the largest circle that can be inscribed between the  supercircle  and the base circles. 
 Maybe some images will make the problem clearer. 
 My final goal is to calculate the diameter of the red circles: 
 
 First step is to put  n  circles of diameter  d  tangent to each other: 
 
 I draw the  supercicle  (yellow) and calculate its diameter  s :

"Assuming there's a pipe infinitely generating black or white stones randomly, with each color having 50% chance. 
 Now someone randomly get 105 stones from the pipe, then randomly put 100 in bowl A and 5 stones in bowl B. It happened that all 5 stones in bowl B are white. 
 Question: in the 100 stones in bowl A, how many are white? 
 There are several ideas here 
 Idea A : Since the pipe generates black or white stones as the same 50% chance, the stones in bowl A shall also have 50%-50% distribution. So the expected value of white stones in the  100 stones in blow A, is $$50\% * 100 =50$$. 
 Idea B : Though the pipe generates black or white stones as the same 50%-50% chance, the 105 stones collected could have different distribution due to the randomness of generation. However, since bowl A (100 stones) and B (5 stones) are taken from the same ""batch"", we assume they have the same distribution, so: 
 $$E(W_A \mid W_B=5) = \sum_{x=1}^{100} \left[ x P(W_A=x \mid W_B=5) \right] =\sum_{x=1}^{100} \left[x \frac{P(W_A=x\, \mathop{\mathtt{AND}}\, W_B=5) } { P(W_B=5)} \right] = \sum_{x=1}^{100} \left[x \frac{P(W_A=x) P(W_B=5 \mid W_A=x) } { P(W_B=5)}\right]$$, where $$P(W_B=5) = \sum_{x=1}^{100} [ P(W_A=x) P(W_B=5 \mid W_A=x)]$$. Then $P(W_A=x)$, $P(W_B=5 | W_A=x)$ both follows binomial distribution. 
 Idea C : Though the pipe generates black or white stones as the same 50%-50% chance, the 105 stones collected could have different distribution due to the randomness of generation. However, since bowl A (100 stones) and B (5 stones) are taken from the same ""batch"", we assume they have the same distribution. But we shall not calculate the $x$ as Ideal B, instead, we shall find the $\hat x$ so that 
$$P_{\hat x}(W_B=5) = \max_x P(W_B=5)$$.
This leads to $\hat x= 100$, so the estimation is $W_A =100$. 
 Idea D : Though the pipe generates black or white stones as the same 50%-50% chance, the 105 stones collected could have different distribution due to the randomness of generation. However, since bowl A (100 stones) and B (5 stones) are taken from the same ""batch"", we assume they have the same distribution. But we shall not calculate the $x$ as Ideal C, reaching $x=100$, totally forgetting the knowledge that the pipe generates black and white stones in a 50%-50% chance.  
 My questions are : 
 Which idea is more reasonable?  
 Is the result of Idea B the same as Idea A? 
 For Idea D I have no formula yet, how shall I combine 50%-50% prior probability together with the testing result of all 5 stones in Bowl B are White?

 $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{3x} - 1}{e^{4x} - 1}$$ 
 using substitution, cancellation, factoring etc. and common standard limits (i.e. not by L'Hôpital's rule). 
 Attempted solution: 
 It is not possible to solve by evaluating it directly, since it leads to a ""$\frac{0}{0}$"" situation. These kinds of problems are typically solved by cancellation and/or direct application of a after some artful substitution in a precalculus context. 
 It was a bit hard to find a good substitution, so I tried several: 
 $t = 3x$ 
 $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{3x} - 1}{e^{4x} - 1} = \{t=3x\} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{t} - 1}{e^{4\frac{t}{3}} - 1}$$ 
 Although this gets me closer to the standard limit 
 $$\lim_{x to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1$$ 
 ...it is not good enough. 
 $t = e^{4x} - 1$ 
 $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{3x} - 1}{e^{4x} - 1} = \{t=e^{4x} - 1\} = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{e^{\frac{3 \ln (t+ 1)}{4}} - 1}{t}$$ 
 Not sure where to move on from here, if it is at all possible. 
 Looks like the denominator can be factored by the conjugate rule: 
 $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{3x} - 1}{e^{4x} - 1} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{3x} - 1}{(e^{2x} - 1)(e^{2x} + 1)}$$

  Let $$k(s, t) = f(g(s, t), h(s, t)).$$

 Solution 
 
 By the chain rule,
  $$k_s = f_xg_s + f_yh_s = \ldots$$

 I want to find the maximum likelihood estimator for  $\lambda$  in the following scenario:  I observe  $Z_1, ..., Z_n$  and  $Y_1, ..., Y_n$  but NOT any of the  $X_i$ . 
 First I need to determine the likelihood and then maximize it over  $\theta > 0$ , but I'm not really sure of the right approach.  I calculate the joint cdf as follows: 
 $$P(Z_i \leq z, Y_i \leq y) = \begin{cases} P(Y_i \leq y), & y \leq z \\ P(Y_i \leq z, Y_i \leq X_i) + P(Y_i \leq y, X_i \leq z, X_i < Y_i), & y > z\end{cases} \\

1-e^{-z} + (e^{-z}-e^{-y})(1-e^{-\lambda z}), & y > z \end{cases}$$

 Alternative Statement of Problem, with New Picture 
 Given three points $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in the Cartesian plane, I would like to find the ellipse which passes through all three points, subject to the following constraints: 
 
 $P_1$ and $P_2$ lie on axes of the ellipse. 
 $\|P_2-P_3\|\le\|P_2-P_1\|$, that is, $P_2$ is not farther from $P_3$ than from $P_1$. (If this is not the case, we can simply swap the labels of $P_1$ with $P_3$ to ensure that it is.) 
 
 In the picture below, let $O$ be the center of the ellipse and let $F_1$ and $F_2$ be foci. Also let $P_1\prime$ and $P_2\prime$ be the points opposite $P_1$ and $P_2$, respectively, on the ellipse. These points $O$, $F_1$, $F_2$, $P_1\prime$, and $P_2\prime$ are unknowns to solve for. How do I find them? (Note: this is  not  homework!) 
 
 Here’s what I know 
 
 The center point $O$ lies on a circle passing through diametrically opposed points $P_1$ and $P_2$ (shown as a dotted line in orange) because the angle ${\angle}P_1OP_2$ must be 90°. 
 $\|P_i-F_1\| + \|P_i-F_2\| = 2r$,   $i \in \{1,2,3\}$.    (The sum of the distances from any point on an ellipse to the foci is a constant value, in this case $2r$.) 
 $\|P_2-P_2\prime\| = 2r$    and    $\|P_2-O\|=r$.    (Follows from #2.) 
 $\|P_1-O\|^2 + \|P_2-O\|^2 = \|P_2-P_1\|^2$.   (Pythagorean Theorem applied to ${\triangle}P_1OP_2$. Follows from #1.) 
 
 What am I missing? 
 Intuition tells me there must be some simple way to find $O$, $F_1$, $F_2$, and $r$ — and yet I don’t see where to take it from here. 
 Below is the original statement of the problem, before the update. The original statement takes more of an algebraic approach, whereas this new statement above takes more of a geometric approach. 
 
 Original Statement of Problem 
 How can I find the unique ellipse that passes through three distinct points  P₁ ,  P₂ , and  P₃ , such that  P₁  and  P₂  lie on the axes of the ellipse, and such that  P₂  is closer to  P₃  than it is to  P₁ ? ( P₃   could  also lie on the same axis as  P₁  in the simplest case, but won’t it ever lie on the same axis as  P₂  because the points are distinct.) More specifically, what I want to find is actually the angle  θ  with which the axis coincident with  P₁  is rotated with respect to the  x -axis, because this will tell me the angle of the line of tangent at  P₂ , which is what I’m ultimately interested in. 
 This is not homework. This is for piecewise (local) curve-fitting of an arbitrary collection of points, where the fitted curve passes through each point using cubic Bézier curve segments. For every triplet of consecutive points, I want to pass an imaginary ellipse through the points, with the middle point (e.g.,  P₂ ) provides a pleasing tangent line from which to derive a pair of Bézier control points. This will provide C₁ continuity in the final curve. 
 
 Approaches I have tried so far 
 
 The first approach I tried was to describe the ellipse parametrically and then scale, rotate, and translate it — and then formulate that as an equation to solve in terms of $\theta$. That ended up reducing to:
$$
\Big(\frac{A\cos\theta - B\sin\theta}{C\sin\theta - D\cos\theta}\Big)^2 +
\Big(\frac{E\cos\theta + F\sin\theta}{G\sin\theta + H\cos\theta}\Big)^2 = 1
$$
where $A$,$B$,$C$,$D$,$E$,$F$,$G$,$H$ are various vector components of deltas between the three points, but that didn't get me anywhere because I have no idea how to solve that. 
 The second approach I tried was to try to calculate $\theta$ as a function of the ratio of $\|\vec{P_2}-\vec{P_3}\|$ over $\|\vec{P_1}-\vec{P_2}\|$, but I was mistaken that this would lead me anywhere, since in hindsight I believe the ratio is only helpful here for circles rather than ellipses. 
 The third approach I tried was to develop a formula for a general ellipse with center $(u,v)$, semi-major/minor axis lengths $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and rotation $\varphi$. This gave me
$$
\Big(\frac{(x-u)\cos\varphi + (y-v)\sin\varphi}{\alpha}\Big)^2 +
\Big(\frac{-(x-u)\sin\varphi + (y-v)\cos\varphi}{\beta}\Big)^2 = 1
$$
which is all well and good, but I can’t see where to go with it. 
 The fourth approach I tried was to write the ellipse in general bivariate quadratic form
$$
Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 , \quad\textrm{(with A,B,C not all zero)}
$$
in which ellipses are represented when $B^2 - 4AC < 0$,
and then write out three linear equations of $A$,$B$,$C$,$D$,$E$,$F$ using $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ as follows:
$$Ax_1^2 + Bx_1y_1 + Cy_1^2 + Dx_1 + Ey_1 + F = 0$$
$$Ax_2^2 + Bx_2y_2 + Cy_2^2 + Dx_2 + Ey_2 + F = 0$$
$$Ax_3^2 + Bx_3y_3 + Cy_2^2 + Dx_3 + Ey_3 + F = 0$$
Where I’m stuck right now is how to codify the $B^2 - 4AC < 0$ requirement into this system of linear equations, and how to codify that $P_1$ and $P_2$ lie on the axes of the ellipse. 
 
 Other approaches? 
 I’m out of ideas. I would think the solution is actually probably rather simple, perhaps involving a few inverse sines or cosines and a square root or two. I haven’t been able to find this particular problem stated anywhere (and therefore no conveniently packaged solution), but I’m sure it can’t be all that unusual. 
 I did have the idea to take my first partial solution (listed above) and do some sort of iterative binary search for $\theta$ (trying different values until the curve passes through $P_3$), but I am much more interested in a closed-formula solution, because this will be executed in a loop over hundreds or thousands of point sets.

"Q: Given the vector fields 
 $A=x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}-y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$,  
 $B=x\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+y\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ 
 Calculate the commutator $\left[A,B\right]$. 
 My thoughts: I immediately assumed we had the following 
 $x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(x\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)-x\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)+x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(y\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)-y\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)+…$ 
 where I've used the standard commutation relations. However I'm now unsure as to whether it should actually be 
 $x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(x\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-x\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(x\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(y\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}-y\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(x\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+…$ 
 This has confused me slightly because in Quantum Mechanics I would usually have done the former calculation and perhaps applied this to some function $f$. This is a differential geometry question where we're considering vector fields and (I'm assuming) these objects commute. I'm now tending towards the latter though because it makes the calculation a lot easier! 
 So help with this particular problem would be great. But also an explanation of whether this would differ if we had operators (in QM for instance) and whether the correct method of the two above is $\textit{always}$ the one to use (if we're considering the commutations of differentials $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$) would be perfect.

 Let's suppose that we have a function defined as follows:

 where  $p$  is a prime number and  $[...]$  are  Iverson brackets .

$$\left(\sum_{n\ge 0}a_nx^n\right)^{-1}=\sum_{n\ge 0}b_nx^n$$ 
 I first thought that my approach would be looking at 
$$\frac{1}{\sum_{n\ge 0}a_nx^n}$$ 
 But I'm more thinking that since we know that a series is invertible in the ring if $a_0$ is invertible in the ring of coefficients.  Thus, since if we assume it is, and since the unit series is $\{1,0,0,0,....\}$ then we have 
 $$\left(\sum_{n\ge 0}a_nx^n\right)\left(\sum_{n\ge 0}b_nx^n\right)=1$$ 
 Thus we know that $a_0b_0=1$ and thus $b_0=\frac1{a_0}$.  And for the remaining terms we are just looking at the convolution generated by the Cauchy Product and so 
 $$0=\sum_{j=0}^ka_jb_{k-j}$$
$$-a_0b_k=\sum_{j=1}^ka_jb_{k-j}$$
$$b_k=\frac{-1}{a_0}\sum_{j=1}^ka_jb_{k-j}$$
And thus we have a recursive definition. 
 Is there another approach that defines the numbers $b_k$ without recursive means?  Are you forced to only recursive methods when operating on the ring of formal power series to calculate coefficents?

"Friends, 
 I am learning some very basic stuff of spectral theory and kind of lost, in some sense. I am trying to find ways to compute the spectra of different operators, when they work and don't work. For example, by applying directly the definitions, I am able to compute the spectrum of the orthogonal projection to be the set $\{0,I\}$. 
 But, in order to find the essential spectrum of some differential operators, say $L=\partial_{xx}+c\partial_{x}+F$ where $F$ is some linearized term of a nonlinear function $f(u)$, I would perform a Fourier transform $\mathfrak{F}(L)$ and calculate the eigenvalues of this operator. (I am not even sure if this is the correct way of doing it.) 
 Other ways are taking different kinds of transforms (which I have no idea; but by talking to some people, I sensed that taking a Laplace transform sometimes works, too!). 
 I think applying directly the definitions would not be possible in at lot of the cases. Can someone give me references for techniques of finding spectra of different operators, when they fail and work? At least, when I see some kind of operator, I would like to know that I have a sense of what to do.

"Im doing a Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation with particles on a sphere and have a question concerning the random movement in a given time step. 
 I understand that to obtain a uniform distribution of random points on the sphere to begin with it is not enough to use the naive simplest way (use spherical coordinates with constant R and pick random angles theta and phi), but one has to for example use one of these methods:  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpherePointPicking.html 
 Looking at another code for a Monte Carlo on a sphere I see a fairly complicated way to generate random moves: pick a random particle, calculate the rotation matrix moving it to the north pole, find a random cartesian vector less than a certain length and move it to the north pole, normalize the cartesian vector and then rotate it back to the vicinity of the original particle position. 
 This is all to get an unbiased new random position. I don`t understand the rationale completely although I suspect it is connected to detailed balance. But my feeling is that there should be an easier (i.e. faster) way to do this. Actually, intuitively I feel that in this case it is ok to find two small random angles theta and phi and add them to the position of the particle - or would this be a mistake?

"I need to understand pointwise and uniform convergence of function series and have several exercise examples. Most of them I was able to solve but I got problems showing that:

 I will show you my thoughts and would be really happy if someone could point out my error. 
 I need to show that: 
 $$
|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon \text{ for } \forall\epsilon>0

 At first I calculate $f(x)$ as the limiting function, which should be: 
 $$
f(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & |x| < 1 \\ 0 & |x| \geq 1\end{cases}
$$ 
 Inserting the limiting function into the $\epsilon$ condition: 
 $$
\begin{split}
|\frac{1}{1+nx^2}-1|&<\epsilon \text{ for } |x| < 1 \\
|\frac{1}{1+nx^2}-0|&<\epsilon \text{ for } |x| \geq 1
\end{split}
$$
For the first case with $|x|<1$ the $\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}{\frac{1}{1+nx^2}}$ is $1$ and thus the inequation becomes $|1-1|<\epsilon$ for $\forall \epsilon>0$ which is true.
For the second case with $|x| \geq 1$ the $\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}{\frac{1}{1+nx^2}}$ is 0 and thus the inequation becomes $|0-0|<\epsilon$ for $\forall\epsilon>0$ which is again true and thus the function series should be uniformly convergent. The solution to the exercise however tells me the function series is pointwise convergent but not uniformly convergent, so there must be some error in my thoughts.

 and the second space is defined similarly  
 $S_1:  u^{*} + \sum \beta_j \hat{u}_{i}$ 
 So the question is, how to calculate the intersection of the two spaces in MATLAB. I know how to calculate it by hand: just set $S_1=S_2$ and derive some relationships for $\alpha$ and $\beta$.  
 The solution (or let's say the output of the matlab script) should be the intersection basis. That is,  
 $S_1\bigcap S_2 : z^{*} + \sum \gamma_k\hat{z}_k$.  
 So the output is vectors $z^{*}$ and $\hat{z}_k$. Of course it is not unique.

 Basically two planes, so the intersection would be a line.

 $S_1\bigcap S_2 : \left(

 My specific example: I am studying a stochastic given process given by 
 $X(t)=\int\limits_{0}^{t}\cos(B(s))\,\text{d}s$, 
 where $B(t)$ is the Wiener process, which is normally distributed over an interval of length $\tau$ with zero mean and variance $\tau$: 
 $B(t+\tau)-B(t)\sim\mathcal{N}(0, \tau)$. 
 I am able to calculate the first and second moments of $X(t)$, see:  Expectation value of a product of an Ito integral and a function of a Brownian motion 
 A couple of thoughts on the matter: 
 1) Integrals of  Gaussian  continuous stochastic processes, such as the Wiener process can be considered as the limit of a sum of Gaussians and are hence themselves Gaussian.  Since $\cos(B(s))$ is  not  Gaussian, this doesn't seem to help here. 
 2) If we can derive an expression for the characteristic function of the process $X(t)$, then we can theoretically invert this to obtain the pdf.  The Feynman-Kac formula enables us to describe the characteristic function in terms of a PDE.  If this PDE has a unique analytic solution then we can make use of this.  In my specific example, this is not the case - the PDE obtained has no analytic solution.  I can provide more detail on this point if required.

"In one of my tutorial classes, when I was studdying in 9th class (I am in 10th now), our tutor gave us a problem saying it’s a difficult one, and to him,  it was incomplete . 
 This is  that  problem: 
 
 In a rectangle  ABCD , point  B  is joined to the points  P  and  Q  on the sides  AD  and  DC  respectively. And  P  and  Q  are joined to form  three  distinct triangle; namely  PDQ or x ,  QCB or y ,  BAP or z  and  BPQ or f . 
 Given the area of  x = 3m^2 ,  y = 4m^2  and  z = 5m^2 , find the area of  f . 
 Note:  all the information regarding this problem has been provided. The dimensions of any of the line segments are  not known . This also means that the exact positions of   P  and  Q   on their respective line segments are also  not known .
   
 
 Because of the lack of information (See  Note ), my tutor declared it as an incomplete problem (he is just a high-school Science and Mathematics teacher, please don’t expect him to think beyond the limits of a typical high-school student, that is, in case he is wrong). 
 After a few hours of brainstorming, I came up with what I called an  ingenious method . But then I felt that my method actually was not accurate. 
 So, can anybody tell me if this problem is complete and solvable, if yes, is my method correct (see below), if no, what is the best/better method to solve it. 
 
 MY METHOD: 
 
 As all the triangles with their areas given are on the edge of the rectangle, we know that they all are  right triangles . So we can say that one of the arms of  the right angle  is  the altitude  and the other is  the base . 
 Now, we can use the formula  (1/2) * base * altitude  to calculate their areas. Lets take  a  as  altitude  and  b  as  base . 
 (Here’s the first part of  the trick ) We now try all possible _a_s and _b_s for the three triangles, where  a  and  b  are  natural numbers only . (This is also where the major weakness of my method is. More numbers, i.e., any  real numbers  should have been tried, but that is infeasible). Note that  all possible values  are those values that form a triangle of that specified area. 
 For triangle  x , we have the following dimensions: 
  - a = 1 ,  b = 6 
  - a = 2 ,  b = 3 
  - a = 3 ,  b = 2 
  - a = 6 ,  b = 1  # 
 For triangle  y , we have the following dimensions: 
  - a = 1 ,  b = 8 
  - a = 2 ,  b = 4 
  - a = 4 ,  b = 2 #
  - a = 8 ,  b = 1 
 For triangle  z , we have the following dimensions: 
  - a = 1 ,  b = 10 
  - a = 2 ,  b = 5 
  - a = 5 ,  b = 2 
  - a = 10 ,  b = 1 # 
 (Here’s the other part of the trick) Then, we select those specific dimensions of triangles, which when placed together form a rectangle. 
 The condition we require: 
 When the triangles are placed together to form a  quadrilateral  the opposite sides of it must be equal. 
 If this  quadrilateral’s  opposite sides are equal, we know that it is a  parallelogram . And as all of the triangles that form the edges are  right angled , we have at least one of the angles of the  parallelogram  right angled_, so we know that this  parallelogram  is a  rectangle .  
 The correct set of dimensions (that we will be using here) are high-lighted in bold, while the once suffixed with a ‘#’ can also be used. 
 So, in  triangle x  we take  PD  as altitude and  DQ  as base.
  In  triangle y  we take  BC  as altitude and  CQ  as base.
  In  triangle z  we take  PA  as altitude and  AB  as base. 
 Henceforth, we now have:
   (PA + PD) = BC 
 (DQ + CQ) = AB 
  Therefore, the condition is matched. 
 WE NOW HAVE THE CORRECT DIMENSIONS OF THE THREE TRIANGLES 
 Now we can either find the area of  f  by finding the area of the rectangle and subtracting it by the areas of the three triangles, or by finding the three triangle’s  hypotenuse  using the  Pythagorean formula  and then apply the _Herron’s formula _on the hypotenuses. I prefer the former.

"As the title says, I'm trying to find the formula that calculates the average cost for a game of chance. 
 Here are the rules of the game - 
 
 There is a  25% chance to win a game 
 The player wants to win exactly  3 games  in  one day . After that he stops playing. 
 There is a  maximum of 10 games per day 
 The player pays for each game. The  cost is 5 coins per game 
 
 What is the average total amount of money the player would have to spend until he reaches a day in which he has won exactly 3 games? 
 
At first, I thought I could use the binomial distribution formula to solve the chance of getting exactly 3 wins in a day and use the result to calculate the average cost.
 $$E(X) = \binom{10}{3}0.25^{3}(0.75)^{7}$$ 
 The result is ~ 0.2502, which means meeting our goal of exactly 3 wins approximately once every 4 games. That didn't seem right. Because the binomial distribution doesn't take into account the fact that the player stops playing after 3 wins. It assumes the player always plays 10 games  every day . 
 Since this didn't seem like the correct answer I wrote a little python program to approximate the true answer. 
 The program simulates 10 million iterations with the rules above (the player has a maximum of 10 games per day, or 3 wins, whichever comes first. A game cost 5 coins and there's a 25% chance to win a game). 
 These were the results - 
 
 The player will have to play an average of  18.329 games  until the goal of a day with exactly 3 wins is met 
 Times that by the cost of 5 coins per game gives us an average cost of  91.64 coins 
 
 The full output of the program can be seen  here . 
 So, is there a way to get to this answer without iterating through 10 million cases? Is there a formula to calculate this?

"Suppose that $X\sim U[0,1]$. I am trying to understand how to derive probability/density of some realization $x \in [0,1]$ conditional on $x \in E\subseteq[0,1]$. The more I think about it, the more I seem to be confused. Any help would be welcome. 
 1) If $Pr(X\in E)>0$, the density seems to be $f_X(x|X \in E)=\frac{f_X(x)}{Pr(X\in E)} $. So for example we can calculate $f_X(x|X \leq 1/2)=\frac{f_X(x)}{1/2}=2f_X(x)=2 $. 
 So far so good. Now suppose that $Pr(X\in E)=0$. 
 2) For example $E=\{1/4, 3/4 \}$. It seems intuitive that the probability of $X=1/$4 is given by
$$
Pr(X=1/4|X \in E)=\frac{f_X(1/4)}{f_X(1/4)+f_X(3/4)}=1/2.
$$
Is this correct? It feels intuitive, but I am not convinced we can use densities in this way to obtain probabilities. If it is correct, can you point me to a more formal explanation of why it works? Also, is it true that for any finite $E$ it holds
$$
Pr(X=x|X \in E)=\frac{f_X(x)}{\sum_{y\in E} f_X(y)}?
$$ 
 3) Now let $E= \{y \in [0,1]: y \in \mathbb{Q} \}$, i.e. $y$ is a rational number. There are infinitely many rational numbers in the unit interval. What is $Pr(X=x|X\in E)$? Intuition suggests that $Pr(X=x|X\in E)=0$. Also, proceeding as in 2) gives $\sum_{y\in E} f_X(y)=\infty$, so that $Pr(X=x|X\in E)=0$. If it is indeed true that $Pr(X=x|X\in E)=0$, would it be possible to calculate the conditional density of $X$, i.e. $f_X(x|X \in E)$? Approach as in 1) doesn't work since $Pr(X=x|X\in E)=0$.

"My apologies if the answer to this question is too easy. I am a mathematics student and the subject of low density parity check codes is new to me. 
 In many papers on LDPC codes, there are plots showing BER (bit error rate) vs SNR (signal to noise ratio). I have designed some codes and I want to show their performance by giving one of these plots. 
 I noticed that most softwares which test these codes on the white gaussian noise channel take the code, max number of iterations, and the noise standard deviation as inputs, and then give the BER as an output. 
 My question is, how do I calculate the SNR (Eb/N0) given the code, max number of iterations, and noise standard deviation for making the plot? 
 For example, there is software that can be downloaded from:  http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/ftp/LDPC-2012-02-11/index.html  which can build random LDPC codes and then test their performance on the white gaussian noise channel.

"I have seem to have two different (but maybe equivalent) notions of what a regular based covering map is. The two notions I have are: 
 
 If $p : (\tilde{X},\tilde{v}) \rightarrow (X,v)$ is a covering map. Then $p$ is regular if and only if any two points in $p^{-1}(v)$ differ by a covering transformation. 
 
 or 
 
 If $p : (\tilde{X},\tilde{v}) \rightarrow (X,v)$ is a covering map. Then $p$ is regular if for any two points $\tilde{v}_{1}, \tilde{v}_{2}$  in $p^{-1}(v)$, a loop $\ell$ based at $v$ in $X$ lifts to a loop $\tilde{\ell}$ in $\tilde{X}$ based at $\tilde{v}_{1}$ if and only if it lifts to a loop in $\tilde{X}$ based at $\tilde{v}_{2}$.  
 
 Then, we know that $(\tilde{X},\tilde{v})$ is a regular covering space of $(X,v)$ if and only if $p_{*}(\pi_{1}(\tilde{X},\tilde{v}))$ is a normal subgroup of $\pi_{1}(X,v)$. 
 I feel like I have an example of a normal subgroup of $F_{2}$ (the free group of two generators), whose unique corresponding regular covering space of $B_{2}$ (the bouquet of two circles) satisfies the second notion of regularity, but not the first. I've spelt out the example here, and I would appreciate it if someone could help me see where I'm going wrong.  
 
 Let $(X,v) = (B_{2},v) $ have the following cell complex: 
 
 Then, consider the map $\phi : F_{2} \rightarrow S_{3} $ such that $x \mapsto (1 \ 2)$ and $y\mapsto (1 \ 2 \ 3)$. Then $\phi$ is a surjective group homomorphism, so $K = \operatorname{ker}(\phi)$ is an index 6 normal subgroup of $F_{2}$.  
 Then let $ p : (\tilde{X},\tilde{v}) \rightarrow (X,v)$ be the unique corresponding covering map such that $p_{*}(\pi_{1}(\tilde{X},\tilde{v})) = K$. Then a loop $\ell$ based at $v$ in $X$ lifts to a loop $\tilde{\ell}$ based at $\tilde{v}$ in $\tilde{X}$ if and only if $[\ell] \in K$. Then, the pre-images of the relations of $S_{3}$ are elements of $K$, and since since $\phi$ maps the two generators of $F_{2}$ to the two generators of $S_{3}$, these pre-images are trivial to calculate. 
 If we equip $S_{3}$ with the presentation $\left< \tau, \sigma \mid \tau^{2}, \sigma^{3}, \tau\sigma\tau\sigma \right>$, where $\tau = (1 \ 2)$ and $\sigma = (1 \ 2 \ 3)$. Then we see that $K$ inherits the elements $x^{2}$, $y^{3}$, and $xyxy$. Hence, the loops $x^{2}, y^{3},$ and $xyxy$ all lift to $(\tilde{X},\tilde{v})$. 
 Then $(\tilde{X},\tilde{v})$ is a regular graph on six vertices, with 4 edges leaving every vertex, such that $x^{2}$ is a loop at every vertex, $y^{3}$ is a loop at every vertex, and $xyxy$ is a loop at every vertex. I think the following graph fits the requirements: 
   
 I think this graph satisfies the second notion of regularity. I cannot find a loop at one vertex that is not a loop at another vertex. However, I can't seem to describe a covering transformation that swaps any of the our vertices with any of the inner ones.

 A company of total value $v$ is distributed amongst 5 people (I refer to their ownership amounts as $x$,$k$,$e$,$m$,$d$ and $s$) according to the following percentages (shares) of the total amount value $v$: 
 $x_0=\frac{4}{13}v$

 $e_0=\frac{2}{13}v$ 
 $m_0=\frac{2}{13}v$ 
 $s_0=\frac{1}{13}v$ 
 Person $x$ decided to leave the company and asked that his share to be distributed amongst the remaining people plus 1 new person $d$. The distribution rule is such that person $s$ would take half of ANY of the persons $k$ or $e$ or $m$ or $d$. 
 The question: 
 For each person involved, find the share (percentage of the total amount) under the above mentioned rules. 
 Note: This is a real-life problem and not a homework - There are no word tricks here or puzzles. Your verification or correction is very much appreciated. Also, if you have a simpler approach, it would be appreciated. Please explain each step clearly if you would, so that I can understand - Thx. 
 My answer: 
 Step1: Calculate each individual share of x's share as follows: 
 share for x will be distributed as: 
 $x_0=k+e+m++d+s$ 
 given that $k=e=m=d$ and that $s=0.5k$ 
 $x_0=4k+0.5k$ 
 $k=\frac{2x_0}{9}$ 
 Since x's share was $x_0=\frac{4}{13}v$ 
 $k=\frac {2}{9} * \frac{4v}{13}$ 
 $k=\frac {8v}{13*9}$ 
 $k=\frac {8v}{117}$ and the same value applies to $m$,$e$,$d$ ----- (EQ 1) 
 $s=\frac {4}{13} * \frac{v}{9}=\frac{4v}{117}$ 
 Step 2: Calculate each individual absolute (final) share value: 
 $x's shares are to introduced individually and person d's shares to be calculated. 
 $k=\frac{4v}{13} + \frac {8v}{117} = \frac{572v}{1521}$ 
 $e=\frac{2v}{13} + \frac {8v}{117} = \frac{338v}{1521}$ 
 $m=\frac{2v}{13} + \frac {8v}{117} =\frac{338v}{1521}$ 
 $s=\frac{v}{13} + \frac{4v}{117} = \frac{169v}{1521}$ 
 The share for $d$ would be calculated as: total percentage value ($v$) - sum of all share percentages above. 
 $d =  1-(\frac{572v}{1521} + \frac{338v}{1521} + \frac{338v}{1521}+\frac{169v}{1521})$ 
 $d=\frac{104v}{1521}$ 
 Same result for $d$ could be obtained from (EQ 1):
$d=\frac {8v}{117}$ 
 What do you think? Is this correct? Thx.

"I am a little puzzled by how the following summation has been written as a convolution, with one of the inputs  reversed  in time. Consider the following sum on the LHS, and the convolution on the RHS. I am trying to ascertain why they are equal. 
 $$
\sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} h[i-l] \ x[i] = h[-l] * x[l]
$$ 
 How/Why was the $h[-l]$ ascertained here? I have read and re-read the wiki on convolution and other links, but I cannot seem to figure out how you get it. Can someone please explain to me step by step what is going on here? Thanks! 
 EDIT: 
 Case1: I am told to assume $g[n] = h[-n]$. This seems to work for this case, but not for another case. In this case, I get: 
 $$
\sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} h[i-l] \ x[i] = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} g[-(i-l)] \ x[i] = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} g[l-i] \ x[i] = g[l] * x[l] = h[-l]*x[l]
$$ 
 This seems to work.  
 Case 2: However, if I try it on a different scenario, it does not work. Suppose we wanted to calculate the convolution sum of $h[k] * h^*[-k]$. The  right  answer is that: 
 $$
h[k] * h^*[-k] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} h[n] \ h*[n+k]
$$ 
 But using this method, I would get: 
 $$
h[k] * h^*[-k] = h[k] * g^*[k] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} h[n] \ g^*[k-n] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} h[n] \ h^*[-(k-n)] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} h[n] \ h^*[n-k]
$$ 
 ...which is not the same as the right answer.

"A fairly well-known (and perplexing) fact is that  the sum of all natural numbers is given the value -1/12 , at least in certain contexts. Quite often, a  ""proof""  is given which involves abusing divergent and oscillating series, and the numbers seem to fit at the end. (There are also other proofs involving the zeta function or other things, but that's not my concern right now). 
 However, I tried to calculate it my own way using similar methods, and this is what I got: 
 $$\begin{align}
S = 1 &+ 2 + 3 + 4 + …\\\\
2S = 1 &+ 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + \ldots\\
       &+ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots\\\\
   = 1 &+ 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \ldots\\
\end{align}$$
Also,
$2S = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + \ldots$ 
 Adding the above together, 
 $$4S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + … = S$$ 
 Which means $3S = 0$, therefore $S = 0$ 
 Obviously, there must be some reason why this is not ok, otherwise we'd have $-1/12 = 0$. 
But why is my method wrong while the one involving oscillating series is considered acceptable? 
 Additional clarification: I was wondering if there are specific ways to manipulate this kind of series such that by assuming that the result is finite and performing only certain types of ""permitted"" operations, one could be confident to get to the same result as the rigorous way of assigning a finite value to the sum of the series. So far, the consensus seems to be negative.

"In a generalization of this problem:  Integral involving product of arctangent and Gaussian , I am trying to calculate the integral 
 $$ I(a,b) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} \arctan^2 {\left( \frac{y+b}{x+a} \right)} e^{- (x^2 + y^2)} d x d y , $$ 
 for  $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$  in terms of commonly used special functions. The substitution that worked in the aforementioned question, i.e. 
 $$ \frac{1}{(x+a) \sqrt{\pi}} \arctan{ \left( \frac{y+b}{x+a} \right) } = \int_0^{\infty} \mathrm{erf} ((y+b)s) e^{-(x+a)^2 s^2} d s , $$ 
 where  $\mathrm{erf}(z) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^z e^{-t^2} d t$  is the standard error function, forces us to consider the integral 
 $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}} \mathrm{erf} ((y+b)t) \mathrm{erf} ((y+b)s) e^{- y^2} d y . $$ 
 In the case of  $b = 0$ , we may use the result 
 $$ \int_0^{\infty} \mathrm{erf}{(ax)} \mathrm{erf}{(bx)} e^{-c^2 x^2} d x = \frac{1}{c \sqrt{\pi}} \arctan{\left( \frac{ab}{c \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} \right)} $$ 
 found in, e.g., formula (18) of page 158 of  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/75B/jresv75Bn3-4p149_A1b.pdf . Making this substitution, we find 
 $$ I(a,0) =  \pi \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^{\infty} r \arctan{ \left( \frac{r \cos{\theta}\sin{\theta}}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} \right) } \exp{ \left\lbrace - \frac{a^2 r^2}{1 + r^2} \right\rbrace} \frac{(1 + 2 a^2 + r^2)}{(1+r^2)^{5/2}} d \theta d r . $$ 
 I would be very happy just to demonstrate a closed-form for  $I(a,0)$  above. However, now I am stuck trying to compute 
 \begin{align}
\int_0^{\pi / 2} \arctan{ \left( \frac{r \cos{\theta}\sin{\theta}}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} \right) } d \theta . \hspace{2cm} (*)
\end{align} 
 Would anyone on this platform know how to compute ( $*$ )? I have tried Mathematica, but it returns some nasty expression. Maybe I am going about this wrong by trying to compute the  $\theta$  integral first? Any ideas about ( $*$ ) or the original integral  $I(a,b)$  are appreciated. I asked about a related integral here:  Integral involving sin, cosine, exponential, and error functions. . The integral in this question is found by starting from polar coordinates with  $I(a,b)$ . Unfortunately, I have not been able to make progress on this integral either. 
 Update:  Observe that 
 $$ \frac{d}{dr} \frac{e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)}}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} = - r \exp{ \left\lbrace - \frac{a^2 r^2}{1 + r^2} \right\rbrace} \frac{(1 + 2 a^2 + r^2)}{(1+r^2)^{5/2}} . $$ 
 We may therefore integrate-by-parts to find 
 \begin{align*}
I(a,0) & = - \pi \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^{\infty} \arctan{ \left( \frac{r \cos{\theta}\sin{\theta}}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} \right) } \frac{d}{dr} \frac{e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)}}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} dr d \theta \\
& ​= \pi \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\cos{\theta} \sin{\theta}}{(1+r^2) (1 + r^2 ( 1 + \cos^2{\theta} \sin^2{\theta} )) } e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)} dr d \theta .
\end{align*} 
 Hopefully this observation simplifies the problem some. Apparently, Mathematica believes 
 $$ \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos{\theta} \sin{\theta}}{1 + r^2 ( 1 + \cos^2{\theta} \sin^2{\theta} ) } d \theta = \frac{2 \mathrm{arctanh}{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} }}{r \sqrt{ 5 r^2  + 4 } } , $$ 
 where  $\mathrm{arctanh}$  is the inverse hyperbolic tangent. I haven't been able to derive this myself though. 
 Update 2:  I was able to make a little more progress on the special case  $I(a,0)$ . Starting from the previous identity involving the hyperbolic  $\mathrm{arctanh}$ , our integral of interest becomes
 \begin{align*}
I(a,0) = 2 \pi \int_0^{\infty} \frac{2 \mathrm{arctanh}{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} }}{r (1 + r^2) \sqrt{ 5 r^2  + 4 } } e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)} d r .
\end{align*} 
Now, observe that
 \begin{align*}
\frac{d }{d r} \mathrm{arctanh}^2{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} } = 2 \frac{\mathrm{arctanh}{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} }}{(1+r^2) \sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} . 
\end{align*} 
Then, via integration-by-parts,
 \begin{align*}
I(a,0) & = 2 \pi \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{r} e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)} \frac{d }{d r} \mathrm{arctanh}^2{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} } d r \\
& = 2 \pi \int_0^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{r^2} + \frac{2a^2}{(1+r^2)^2} \right) e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)} \mathrm{arctanh}^2{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} } d r . 
\end{align*} 
Now we look to making the Euler substitution to simplify the integral. Let  $\sqrt{ 5 r^2 + 4 } = \sqrt{5} r + t$ . Then,
 \begin{align*}
r = \frac{4 - t^2}{2 \sqrt{5} t} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{10} \left( \frac{4}{t} - t \right).  
\end{align*} 
Consequently,
 \begin{align*}
d r = - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{10} \left( \frac{4}{t^2} + 1 \right) d t . 
\end{align*} 
Plugging this into our integral and simplifying reveals
 \begin{align}
I(a,0) = 4 \pi \sqrt{5}  \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} (4 + t^2) \left( \frac{1}{(t^2 - 4)^2} + \frac{40 a^2 t^2}{(t^4 + 12 t^2 + 16)^2} \right) e^{- \frac{a^2 (t^2 - 4)^2}{16+12t+t^2}} \mathrm{arctanh}^2{ \left( \frac{t^2 - 4}{ \sqrt{5} (t^2 + 4)} \right) } d t .   
\end{align} 
 It is starting to seem as though some ""closed-form"" in terms of  $a$  is possible. Due to the appearance of  $\mathrm{arctanh}^2$  in the previous integral, I am inclined to conjecture that  $\mathrm{arctanh}$  is part of the final answer. This would be a nice ""duality"" with this integral and the final answer to the related one in the question linked at the very top. 
 Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could proceed?

"Please note that we assume the observer's eye line is exactly at sea level (0 inches) and we are assuming a perfect spherical earth with no atmospheric effects.  The idea here is an alternative approach to evaluating the curvature of the earth since ""distance to horizon"" appears to be already covered eg.  http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-the-Distance-to-the-Horizon 
 Diagram of Problem 
 PLEASE VIEW DIAGRAM HERE - TL;DR SOLVE FOR D KNOWING R AND X 
 Is this correct? 
 $$D = \sin{(90-\tan^-1{(\frac{X}{R})})} * (\sqrt{R^2+X^2}-R)$$ 
 Long Version: 
 An observer stands at point $P^0$ at $0$ inches of elevation and looks in a direct straight line over a distance of $X$ miles to point $P^1$.    
 The ground curves away from the observer's eye line, the eye line being tangential from point $P^0$ to point $P^1$ (and beyond) over a spherical earth. 
 Hence a right-angle triangle is formed between $P^0$, $P^1$ and the centre of the earth ($C^0$)with radius $R$, acute angle $a$, and hypotenuse $R+H$. 
 Clearly the ""concentric height"" $H$ ie. from $P^1$ to the ground (point $P^2$) in this right-angle triangle is: $$H = \sqrt{R^2+X^2}-R$$  
 As the distance $X$ inreases the ""concentric height"" $H$ increases in accordance to the curvature of the earth. This is known colloquially as ""8 inches per miles squared"", for example, approximately: 1 mile gives 8 inches, 2 miles gives 32 inches, 3 miles gives 72 inches and 10 miles gives 800 inches. 
 As the observer is looking at 0 inches of elevation in a straight line any objects in their eye line higher than sea level will obviously be visible but will eventually curve away until it is impossible to see whether the observer uses eyesight, optical zoom or laser techniques. 
 An issue arises when we want to calculate the "" dropoff "" straight ""down"" to the ground perpendicular to the eye line of the observer. That is, a ""dropoff"" $D$ which is the opposite face of a right-angle triangle between $P^1$, a point along the straight eye line (a distance less than $X$, point $P^3$) and the ground point $P^2$. 
 How do you calculate this ""dropoff""? Here is my method, could there be a mistake in it? 
 As you can see from the diagram, we can establish the following. 
 The ""concentric height"" $H$ is: $$H = \sqrt{R^2+X^2}-R$$  
 The acute angle (arc originating from the centre of the earth) $a$ is: $$a = \tan^-1{(\frac{X}{R})}$$ 
 The smaller right-angle triangle relevant to $D$ within the larger right-angle triangle is formed between $P^3$, $P^1$ and $P^2$ with acute angle b where: $$b = 90 -a$$ 
 The dropoff $D$ can then be defined as: $$D = \sin{(b)}* H$$ 
 Hence the final formula of: $$D = \sin{(90-\tan^-1{(\frac{X}{R})})} * (\sqrt{R^2+X^2}-R)$$ 
 ""Dropoff"" Example Calculations - Corrected Aug 29 2016 
 Eg. Find dropoff in inches, for 10 miles ""eyeline distance"" $X$ per diagram above, with an earth of radius 3959 miles, enter into Wolfram Alpha online:  (sin(pi/2-arctan(10/3959))) * (sqrt(3959^2+10^2)-3959) * 63360 .

 Further Research 
 
 A formula should be derived to factor in the height of the observer from sea level  
 A formula should be derived for the distance $X^B$ which is the arc length (ground distance) from the observer. (Edit: one of the answers below has provided this). 
 A formula should be derived to factor in the angle of observation. 
 Empirical tests should be conducted using optical zoom (300mm and greater magnification) and highly-focused lasers all at different points on the earth at different dates and times. 
 The radius of approx. 4000 miles used is for observations longitudinally North to South at 0 degrees Longitude, or for observations latitudinally East to West at 0 degrees Latitude. This radius would be smaller for observations across a sphere at different points, eg. observations latitudinally East to West at 40 degrees Latitude cf. ""Circumference of the earth at different latitudes"" formula.

It is about answer by Sándor Kovács of a question
 https://mathoverflow.net/questions/55526/example-of-a-variety-with-k-x-mathbb-q-cartier-but-not-cartier 
 Kovács gave an example $X$. Basically this $X$ is a toric variety. It is not hard to calculate class group of $X$. For any toric variety class group is generated by tor-invariant divisors. For $X$ there are three such divisors. Set theoretically they are defined by equations $x^2=0$, $y^2=0$ and $z^2=0$. But those functions have zero of order two on corresponding divisors. So it is better to write 
 $$D_1 = \frac{1}{2} div( x^2 )$$
$$D_2 = \frac{1}{2} div( y^2 )$$
$$D_3 = \frac{1}{2} div( z^2 )$$ 
 Relations between these divisors are generated by monomials.
$$D_1 + D_2 = div (xy) = 0$$
$$2 D_3 = div(z^2) = 0$$
$$ \dots $$ 
 Relations are as follows $D_1 + D_2$, $D_2 + D_3$, $D_3 + D_1$, $2D_1$, $2D_2$, $2D_3$. 
 Evidently the class group which is generated by $D_1$, $D_2$ and $D_3$ modulo relations is just $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$. After tensoring with $\mathbb{Q}$ it becomes 0. 
 So the $K_X$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$ divisor which is just zero. But $\pi^* K_X$ is not zero as a $\mathbb{Q}$ divisor (it follows from Kovács calculations).

"I would like a method for computing $\pi$ for which I have an explicit bound on the error, and that has the property that if I do the calculation up to a certain accuracy, but then need an arbitrarily finer accuracy later, I can pick up the calculation process where I left off rather than having to start over from scratch. In light of the second requirement, I don't want to have to deal with, say, square roots, because whatever accuracy I calculate the roots to in order to reach some desired accuracy for $\pi$, there is some finer accuracy for which the root approximations already used would have needed to be more accurate. I believe I'll want to stick to algorithms for which the operations required are limited to arithmetic on rationals in order to avoid such issues. 
 The Maclaurin series for $4\arctan(1)$ is an example of an algorithm that obeys these properties:
$$\pi=4\arctan(1)=4\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{2n+1}$$
Provided I save the value of $n$ for the last term I added, it's easy to resume the calculation, and I always know that the magnitude of the error is less than that of the next term. 
 However, I know that this algorithm converges very slowly. What contenders are there for faster algorithms that obey the desired constraints? It sounds like an unbounded spigot algorithm would work, but if I'm not mistaken, those are subject to  more  constraints than I care about, so maybe it's possible to do better.

"I see a question in Chinese senior high schools books: 
 
 Throwing a fair coin until either there is one Head or four Tails.
  Find the expectation of times of throwing.
  (You start throwing a coin, if you see Head, then the game suddenly over; and if you see four Tail, the game is over too. Only these two situation can the game be over.) 
 
 (The answer is $1\times\frac{1}{2}+2\times\frac{1}{4}+\cdots=\frac{15}{8}$) 
 I know that, if we want to calculate the expectation, we, of course, need to find the random variable first. In order to find the random variable, we need to know the sample space of the experiment. However, how can we say about this sample space? The throwing times are varing, not a constant like 3. If the times we throw is 3, the sample space is $\{(a_1,a_2,a_3)\mid \forall 1\le i\le 3,~a_i\in\{H,T\}\}$. But the sample space like this question, is not like this one. What is its sample space?

"I have been trying to solve this problem for hours... 
At this point, I believe that there is a mistake in the problem, but I assume that I am in the one who is wrong. May you help me? 
 Here is the problem: 
 Let $f_n(x)= \frac{nx}{3+nx},\ n\in \mathbb{N},\ \text{and}\ x>0.$ 
 a) Show that the sequence $\{f_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges uniformly on $[a, \infty)$ for any $a>0$ 
 b) Show that the sequence $\{f_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ does not converge uniformly on $\mathbb{R}$. 
 Here is my perspective: 
 To prove that the sequence converges uniformly I need to find an $N$ that depends only on epsilon. I am using this definition: 
 
 I made a graph with some of the functions: 
 Here is the graph: 
 
 According to the graph, from $[1, \infty)$, the limit of the $f_n$ is $1$, but when $x$ is close to 0 the limit, from the right, is $0$. 
 Then I am wondering is the a of the problem $[a, \infty)$ must be greater or equal than 1 instead of greater than 0 to get uniform convergence. 
 When I calculate absolute value of $f_n(x) - f(x),$ 
I am getting $nx > \frac{3}{\varepsilon} - 3$. 
 I do not see how to find an N that depends only on epsilon.

The question: 
 
 An airplane flies, and we know its ground speed and direction.  There is a wind of unknown speed and direction. The airplane changes its heading, so that we have a new ground speed and direction. The airplane speed with respect to air does not change.  Can we calculate the wind speed and direction based on this information? 
 
 What we have is: 
 Vector  $C_1$ : Ground Speed 1 and Direction 1, all known 
 Vector  $C_2$ : Ground Speed 2 and Direction 2, all known 
 Vector  $A_1$ : Air Speed (same)  Direction  $B_1$  (unknown) 
 Vector  $A_2$ : Air Speed (same) Direction  $B_2$  (unknown) 
 Vector  $B_1$ : Wind Speed and Direction (same) 
 Vector  $B_2$ : Wind Speed and Direction  (same) 
 This question has practical use for determining wind speed from UAVs. One easy way to measure wind speed is to make a  $360$  degree circle and then obtain the wind speed which is half the difference between minimum and maximum ground speed. I wounder if it is possible to obtain the same result without doing a full circle, but just change course by a smaller angle ( $60 - 90$  degrees) and use the changes in ground speed to determine the wind speed 
 I am not sure how to tackle it, but I feel that since we have the same airspeed, we probably could solve it...

 Since $\Omega^k(M)$ is the space of $(k,0)-$ anti-symmetric tensor  fields  on $M$, it is in fact a $C^{\infty}(M)$  module . We then define
 $B^k(M) = \{\omega\in\Omega^k(M) \::\: \exists \alpha \in\Omega^{k-1}(M) \text{ such that } d\alpha = \omega\}$ (the space of ""exact forms""), and $Z^k(M) = \{\omega \in \Omega^k(M) \::\: d\omega = 0\}$ (the space of ""closed"" forms). It's not difficult to check that these are sub modules  of $\Omega^k(M)$. 
 Then we define $H^k_{dR}(M) = Z^k(M)/B^k(M)$, and I'm told this is a quotient vector space. Why is it not a $C^\infty(M)$ module? When did it become a vector space? If it were defined as $Z^k(T_p(M))/B^k(T_pM)$ (exact and closed forms on $T_p(M)$), this would make a lot more sense, but then it would be a different vector space at every point that we could potentially ""glue"" together like the tangent bundle. Is this the case?  
 Then when I go to calculate $H^1_{dR}(S^1)$, it's again treated as a vector space, and I'm supposed to show it's isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$, but shouldn't it be $\Omega^1(\mathbb{R})$ since this is a $C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ module?

"I'll lay out the problem as a simplified puzzle of what I am attempting to calculate. I imagine some of this may seem fairly straightforward to many but I'm starting to get a bit lost in my head while trying to think through the problem. 
 Let's say I roll a 1000-sided die until it lands on the number 1. Let's say it took me 700 rolls to get there. I want to prove that the first 699 rolls were not number 1 and obviously the only way to deterministically do this is to include the first 699 failures as part of the result to show they were in fact ""not 1"". 
 However, that's a lot of data I would need to prove this. I would have to include all 700 rolls, which is a lot. Therefore, I want to probabilistically demonstrate the fact that I rolled 699 ""not 1s"" prior to rolling a 1. To do this, I decide I will randomly sample my ""not 1"" rolls to reduce the set to a statistically significant, yet more wieldy number. It will be good enough to demonstrate that I very probably did not roll a 1 prior to roll 700. 
 Here are my current assumptions about the state of this problem: 
 
 My initial experiment of rolling until success is one of geometric distribution. 
 However my goal for this problem is to demonstrate to a third party that I am not lying, therefore the skeptical third party is not concerned with geometric distribution but would view this simply as a binomial distribution problem. 
 
 A lot of sample size calculators exist on the web. They are all based around binomial distribution from what I can tell. So here's the formula I am considering: 
 $$
n = \frac{N \times X}{X + N – 1}
$$ 
 $$
X = \frac{{Z_{\alpha/2}}^2 ­\times p \times (1-p)}{\mathsf{MOE}^2}
$$ 
 
 $n$  is sample size 
 $N$  is population size 
 $Z$  is critical value ( $\alpha$  is  $1-\mathsf{confidence\space level\space as\space probability}$ ) 
 $p$  is sample proportion 
 $\mathsf{MOE}$  is margin of error 
 
 As an aside, the website where I got this formula says it implements ""finite population correction"", is this desirable for my requirements? 
 Here is the math executed on my above numbers. I will use  $Z_{a/2}=2.58$  for  $\alpha=0.01$ ,  $p=0.001$  and  $\mathsf{MOE}=0.005$ . As stated above,  $N=699$  on account of there being 699 failure cases that I would like to sample with a certain level of confidence. 
 Based on my understanding, what this math will do is recommend a sample size that will show, with 99% confidence, that the sample result is within 0.5 percentage points of reality. 
 Doing the math,  $X=265.989744$  and  $n=192.8722086653\approx193$ , implying that I can have a sample size of 193 to fulfill this confidence level and interval. 
 My main question is whether my assumption about  $p=\frac{1}{1000}$  is valid. If it's not, and I use the conservative  $p=0.5$ , then my sample size shoots up to  $\approx692$ . So I would like to know if my assumptions about what sample proportion actually is are correct. 
 More broadly, am I on the right track at all with this? From my attempt at demonstrating this probabilistically to my current thought process, is any of this accurate at all? Thank you.

 Imagine you have a pentagon and you want to color the corners of the pentagon so that no two adjacent corners have the same color. If you have 'q' colors, how many ways of coloring the pentagon are possible. 
 I say that the answer is $q^2*(q-1)^2*(q-2) + q*(q-1)*(q-2)^2*(q-3)$. 
 My friend says the answer is $MyAnswer + q*(q-1)*(q-2)*(q-3)*(q-4)$.

 Further if you could point out a resource that explains how to calculate this question for other numbers of corners (say an hexagon) we would really appreciate it.

 Answering to some comments in the answer, rotations of the pentagon should not be counted. What I mean is that if we have 5 colors (a,b,c,d,e) the pentagon with corners {(1,a),(2,b),(3,c),(4,d),(5,e)} is exactly the same as {(1,c),(2,d),(3,e),(4,a),(5,b)}

"Let $$A=\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & -4 & 0\end{bmatrix}$$ 
 I want to determine $e^{At}$. I tried it using two methods. 
 First via the Jordan form: 
 The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is given by $$\det(I\xi-A)=\begin{vmatrix}
\xi & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & \xi & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \xi & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}=1\cdot\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \xi & -1 \\ 0 & 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}+\xi\cdot\begin{vmatrix}
\xi & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \xi & -1 \\ 0 & 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}$$ 
 $$\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \xi & -1 \\ 0 & 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}=1\cdot\begin{vmatrix}
\xi & -1 \\ 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}=\xi^{2}+4\qquad\text{and}\qquad \begin{vmatrix}
\xi & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \xi & -1 \\ 0 & 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}=\xi\cdot\begin{vmatrix}
\xi & -1 \\ 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}=\xi(\xi^{2}+4)$$ 
 $$\implies\det(I\xi-A)=\xi^{2}+4+\xi(\xi^{3}+4\xi)=\xi^{4}+5\xi^{2}+4=(\xi^{2}+4)(\xi^{2}+1)$$ Then the eigenvalues are given by $\lambda_{1,2}=\pm i$ and $\lambda_{3,4}=\pm 2i$. Now, computing the corresponding eigenvectors: 
 For $\lambda=i$, we have $$\begin{cases}
-ix+y=0 \\ -x-iy=0 \\ iz+w=0 \\ -4z-iw=0
\end{cases}\implies\begin{cases}
x=-y \\ 4z=-w
\end{cases}$$ Then setting $x=a$ and $z=b$, for $a,b\in\mathbb{C}$, we obtain: 
 $$v_{1}=\begin{pmatrix}
a \\ -a \\ b \\ -4b
\end{pmatrix}=a\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}+b\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ -4
\end{pmatrix}$$ 
 Similarly, for $\lambda=-i$, we compute, for complex $c,d$: $$v_{2}=c\begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}+d\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 4
\end{pmatrix}$$ 
 For $\lambda=2i$, we get: $$v_{3}=j\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}+k\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ -2
\end{pmatrix}$$ 
 And finally, for $\lambda=-2i$: $$v_{4}=m\begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}+n\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 2
\end{pmatrix}$$ 
 Define $S=\begin{bmatrix}
v_{1} & v_{2} & v_{3} & v_{4}
\end{bmatrix}$. Then $$S=\begin{bmatrix}
a & -c & j & -m \\ -a & c & -j & m \\ b & -d & k & -n \\ -4b & 4d & -2k & 2n
\end{bmatrix}$$ 
 But I have to calculate $S^{-1}$ via this method (which seems a bit too complicated), since $e^{At}=Se^{S^{-1}ASt}S^{-1}$. 
 Then I tried to compute $e^{At}$ using the theory of autonomous behaviours: 
 So I said that every strong solution of $\frac{d}{dt}x=Ax$ is of the form $$x(t)=B_{10}e^{-it}+B_{20}e^{it}+B_{30}e^{-2it}+B_{40}e^{2it}$$ 
 The vectors $B_{ij}$ should satisfy the relations $$(-i\cdot I-A)B_{10}=0$$ $$(i\cdot I-A)B_{20}=0$$ $$(-2i\cdot I-A)B_{30}=0$$ $$(2i\cdot I-A)B_{40}=0$$ 
 Solving these equations yield $B_{10}=v_{1}$, $B_{20}=v_{2}$, $B_{30}=v_{3}$, $B_{40}=v_{4}$, as calculated previously. 
 Hence every solution of $x$ can be written as $$x(t)=a\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}e^{-it}+b\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 4\end{bmatrix}e^{-it}+c\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}e^{it}+d\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}e^{it} +j\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}e^{-2it}+k\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}e^{-2it}+m\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}e^{2it}+n\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}e^{2it}$$ 
 From this we can obtain four linearly independent solutions: 
 $$x_{1}(t)=\begin{bmatrix}-e^{it} \\ e^{it} \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}\qquad x_{2}(t)=\begin{bmatrix}e^{2it} \\ -e^{2it} \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}\qquad x_{3}(t)=\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ e^{it} \\ 4e^{it}\end{bmatrix} \qquad x_{4}(t)=\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ e^{2it} \\ -2e^{2it}\end{bmatrix}$$ 
 The matrix $X$ is defined as $X=\begin{bmatrix}x_{1} & x_{2} & x_{3} & x_{4}\end{bmatrix}$ 
 Then $e^{At}=\Phi(t):=X(t)X^{-1}(0)=\text{something really complicated, so I think I went wrong somewhere}$

 1) not possible to form = 1,1,4 / 1,1,5 / 1,1,6 / 1,2,6 
 then possibilities =  $1-\frac{1}{6}*\frac{1}{6}*\frac{1}{6}*3 - \frac{1}{6}*\frac{1}{6}*\frac{1}{6}*3 - \frac{1}{6}*\frac{1}{6}*\frac{1}{6}*3 - \frac{1}{6}*\frac{1}{6}*\frac{1}{6}*6$   $= \frac {67}{72}$

lim as x approaches negative infinity of the function is equal to the limit as x approaches infinity of ${5 \over (e^x)-2}$, which I found by dividing both numerator and denominator by $e^x$.

 There're 2 parallel planes $P_1, P_2$ and the distance between them is 2. $P_1$ goes through points $A=(2,0,3)$ and $B=(0,0,6)$ and $P_2$ goes through point $C=(-2,0,2)$. Find the equations of the planes. 
 
 I thought of the following although the solution seems not correct and too long. First this is the visualization that I made and I hope is correct:
 
 First we can find $\underline u$ the normal vector of vectors $BA$ and $BC$ through cross product which is: 
 $$\underline u=<2,0,-3> \times <-2,0,-4>=<0,14,0>$$ 
 Now we can find $\underline n_1$ the normal vector of plane $P_1$ from: $$\underline n_1=\underline u \times BA=<0,14,0> \times <2,0,-3>=<42,0,28>$$
Now we have the plane equation of $P_1: 42x+28z+d=0$ after dividing by $14$ becomes: $3x+2z+{d \over 14}=0$. 
 I understand the normal vectors for $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the same but $d$'s are different. I could calculate the $d$ from the distance formula:
$$
D=\frac{|3x+2z+d|}{\sqrt{3^2+2^2}}=2
$$ 
 But then how would I find the $d$ for $P_2$?

 The question is from the exercises section of a textbook chapter on limits/continuity. 
 I've been stumped on this one for a couple of days. I've been trying to calculate $\lim _{x \to -1}$ and $\lim _{x \to 1}$ and then show the function is continuous to show a root must lie in the interval. Factorising the denominators gives... 
 $$\frac{a}{(x+1)(x^2+x-1)} + \frac{b}{(x-1)(x^2+x+2)} = 0$$ 
 So of course $x = 1$ and $x = -1$ are undefined and so the limits will be one-sided. Playing around with equation I haven't been able to find an equivalent function across $x \neq -1, x \neq 1$. 
 The only thing I have been able to show is 
 $$\frac{a}{b} = - \frac{(x+1)(x^2+x-1)}{(x-1)(x^2+x+2)}$$

For example, if I roll a 3, I would calculate the probability with the expression  $(\frac{1}{6}) (\frac{1}{2})^3 \binom{3}{2} + (\frac{1}{6}) (\frac{1}{2})^3\binom{3}{3})= \frac{1}{12}$  and then add up the probabilities of getting at least two for each rolls, since the events are disjoint, summing to  $\frac{67}{128}$ . Is this a valid solution? Is there a better approach to solving this problem?

 Suppose I want to paint the surface of a parabolic dish, how would I calculate that area? 
 To make it slightly more clear, this type of thing: 
 
 Where a cross section of it would be some function: 
 $y = a x^2\quad$    (1) 
 from $y = 0$ (what I will call the vertex) to some point $y=h$ at the opening of the dish. 
 I thought then that the radius at a certain height would be: 
 $r = \sqrt{\frac{y}{a}}\quad$    (2) 
 and therefore the radius at the top, $d$, would be given by the equation: 
 $d = \sqrt{\frac{h}{a}}$ 
 or in other words: 
 $a = \frac{h}{d^2}$ 
 So I rewrote (1) and (2) using that: 
 $y = \frac{h}{d^2} x^2 \quad$    (3) 
 $r = \sqrt{\frac{d^2y}{h}}\quad$    (4) 
 Now I can find the areas of small strips around the dish, and integrate. And this is where I get a bit stuck. I initially did the area of rectangles, but of course the strips (if you unfold them) are actually like this: 
 
 (of course they're not exactly like that because that's a cone and we have a dish, but they're similar in how they're both not rectangles for almost the same reason, if that makes sense) 
 And I have no idea how to express that area mathematically...

"This is the specific question I refer to (exam practice): 
 Particle P has mass 3kg and particle Q has mass 2kg. The particles are moving in

before the collision, P has speed 3 ms^–1 and Q has speed 2 ms^–1. Immediately after the
collision, both particles move in the same direction and the difference in their speeds is
1 ms^–1.

What is news is that in my case I  know  there is a path out, and I'm wondering if a gradient calculation will help me find it. Here is my situation,... Imagine a bowl-shaped surface centered at x = 0, y = 0. Now imagine that there is a path out of this bowl but that it lies perfectly on the diagonal (so where x = y). In this case I think the partial derivative in the x-direction will tell me that I'm at the bottom of a 'U' and that there is no where to go, whilst the partial derivative in the y-direction will also tell me the same. So in the end the gradient should also tell me that I'm stuck at the bottom of a bowl. Is this correct? In other words,... do gradients have  blind spots ? Is it true that the 'gradient' calculation is in essence just an  approximation based on 'sample' partial derivatives taken in the respective directions of the
 coordinate system ? So if I change the coordinate system I might very well get a different value for the gradient even for the same point on the surface? Or is there another type of 'gradient' that I can calculate which will tell me how to get out of the bowl regardless of coordinate system?

 As you can see, the vase is not a perfect cylinder or sphere that could be easily modelled. I figured that one method to calculate the evaporation time mathematically would be to, using polynomial regression, model the shape of the vase on a software like GeoGebra, use integration (volumes of revolution) to turn my 2D model of the shape of the vase into a 3D one, and then use basic differential calculus to calculate the rate of evaporation. 
 I understand polynomial regression, and how the method of least squares could be applied - however, I am a little stuck as to how I can begin the method.

 Let $f:[0,1]\longrightarrow R$ be a continuous function,Calculate the limit
  $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\dfrac{(2n+1)!}{(n!)^2}\int_{0}^{1}(x(1-x))^nf(x)dx$$ 
 
 My try:use this 
 
 $$n!\approx\left(\dfrac{n}{e}\right)^n\sqrt{2n\pi}$$
  so
  $$\dfrac{(2n+1)!}{(n!)^2}\approx\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{2n+1}{e}\right)^{2n+1}\sqrt{2(2n+1)\pi}}{\left(\dfrac{n}{e}\right)^{2n}\cdot 2n\pi}=\dfrac{\sqrt{2n+1}}{e\sqrt{2\pi}}\left(2+\dfrac{1}{n}\right)^{2n+1}$$

"Given a Vandermonde matrix $\mathbf{V}$ with Gaussian iid nodes. To simplify argument, assume $2\times 2$ with nodes $X_1, X_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ and iid, i.e., $\mathbb{E}(X_1 X_2)=\mathbb{E}(X_1)\mathbb{E}(X_2)$. 
 $$
\mathbb{E}\det(\mathbf{V}) = \mathbb{E}\left\{\left| \begin{matrix} X_1 & X_1^2 \\ X_2 & X_2^2 \end{matrix} \right| \right\} = \mathbb{E}\left\{ X_1 X_2^2 - X_2 X_1^2 \right\} = \mathbb{E}\left\{ X_1 X_2^2 \right\} - \mathbb{E}\left\{X_2 X_1^2 \right\} = \\
= \mathbb{E}\left\{ X_1 \right\} \mathbb{E}\left\{ X_2^2 \right\} - \mathbb{E}\left\{X_2 \right\} \mathbb{E}\left\{X_1^2 \right\} = 0
$$ 
 So a Vandermonde matrix is expected to be singular (I can generalize this with Laplace expansion). It implies that at least one eigenvalue is zero. 
 Next, calculate: 
 $$
\mathbb{E}\det(\mathbf{V}^T \mathbf{V}) =
\mathbb{E}(\det\mathbf{V})^2 =
\mathbb{E}\left\{ (X_1 X_2^2 - X_2 X_1^2)^2 \right\} =
\mathbb{E}\left\{ X_1^2 X_2^4 \right\}
-2\mathbb{E}\left\{ X_1 X_2^2 X_2 X_1^2 \right\}
+\mathbb{E}\left\{X_2^2 X_1^4 \right\} =
\mathbb{E}\left\{X^2\right\}\mathbb{E}\left\{ X^4 \right\}
-2\mathbb{E}\left\{ X_2^3 X_1^3 \right\}
+\mathbb{E}\left\{X^2\right\} \mathbb{E}\left\{ X^4 \right\} = \\
2\mathbb{E}\left\{X^2\right\}\mathbb{E}\left\{ X^4 \right\}
-2\mathbb{E}\left\{ X_2^3 X_1^3 \right\} = \\
2\mathbb{E}\left\{X^2\right\}\mathbb{E}\left\{ X^4 \right\}
-2\mathbb{E}\left\{ X^3 \right\}^2 = 6\sigma^6
$$ 
 This follows from $\det(\mathbf{A B}) = \det(\mathbf{A})\det(\mathbf{B})$ and $\det(\mathbf{A}^T) = \det(\mathbf{A})$. The result is nonzero, implying no zero eigenvalues. 
 However, $\mathbf{A}^T$ has the same eigenvalues as $\mathbf{A}$. Hence: 
 $$
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i = \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i \\
\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_i = \lambda_i \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{v}_i \\
= \lambda_i (\lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i) = \lambda_i^2 \mathbf{v}_i
$$ 
 Therefore the eigenvalues should be related by a square and if $\mathbf{A}$ contains a zero eigenvalue, so should $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$.

"I premise that I do not know anything about fractionary ideals and class groups of Dedekind domains. But I know the theory of divisors on regular schemes, as treated in Hartshorne. What I would like to know is if there exist some geometric approaches to calculate the class group of a Dedekind domain. 
 In fact, for an algebraic variety $X$, the usual method consists of choosing an open subset $U$ of $X$ such that it is easy to prove that $Cl \ U = 0$ and then finding $1$-codimension points of $X \setminus U$. These points are generators of the group $Cl \ X$ and, with rational functions, one finds the relations among them.

 if $f'''(x)$ is continuous everywhere and $$\lim_{x \to 0}(1+x+ \frac{f(x)}{x})^{1/x}=e^3$$ Compute $f''(0)$ 
 
 The limit equals to $$\begin{align} \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\log(1+x+ \frac{f(x)}{x})}{x}-3=0.  \end{align}$$ 
From $$\frac{\log(1+x+ \frac{f(x)}{x})}{x}-3=o(1)$$ as $x \to 0$, I get $$1+x+\frac{f(x)}{x} = e^{3x+o(x)},$$ and  $$f(x)=x(e^{3x+o(x)}-x-1),\frac{f(x)}{x}=e^{3x+o(x)}-x-1$$ as $x \to 0$. So both $f(0)$ and $f'(0)$ are $0$. Approximating $e^{3x+o(x)}=1+3x+o(x)$ I get $$\begin{align} f(x) &= x(1+3x+o(x)-x-1) =2x^2+o(x^2). \end{align}$$

"After seeing  this  recent question asking how to calculate the following integral 
 $$ \int \frac{1 + x^2}{(1 - x^2) \sqrt{1 + x^4}} \, dx $$ 
 and some of the comments that suggested that it was an elliptic integral, I tried reading a little bit on the Wikipedia article about  elliptic integrals .
It seems that the point is that most elliptic integrals cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. The Wikipedia article defines an elliptic integral as an integral of the form 
 $$\int R \left( x, \sqrt{ P(x) } \right ) \, dx$$ 
 where $R(x, y)$ is a rational function and $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3$ or $4$ with no repeated roots. 
 Now, the article does mention in its introductory section that two exceptions in which the elliptic integrals can be expressed in terms of elementary functions are when the polynomial $P(x)$ has repeated roots or when the rational function $R(x, y)$ does not contain odd powers of $y$.  
 In the example in question we have $P(x) = 1 + x^4$ and  
 $$R(x, y) = \frac{1 + x^2}{(1 - x^2)y}$$ 
 so certainly it does not correspond to the two exceptions mentioned before. Thus I have a couple of questions about this: 
 
 1) What are the conditions for an elliptic integral (as defined in the Wikipedia article) to be expressible in terms of elementary functions? More specifically, are the two above cited conditions the only exceptions or are there any others which may explain why the above integral is expressible in terms of elementary functions? 
 2) Depending on the answer to my first question, why is it that the above ""elliptic integral"" can be expressed in terms of elementary functions? 
 
 Note: I'm not sure but I suppose that some conditions must be put on the rational function $R(x, y)$ so to avoid trivial cases, but I don't want to speculate.

 I would like to know if my proof holds, please. And, I would like have a hint on how we can calculate the intergal of this such of functions, please. 
 My attempt is to pass by Darboux upper and lower sums. 
 To show that  $f$  is Riemann integrable, we have to show the following: $\forall \epsilon>0$   $\exists$  a partition  $\sigma$ :  $\overline{S}_{\sigma}(f)<\underline{S}_{\sigma}(f)+\epsilon$ . 
 Let  $0<\epsilon<2$  and consider the following intervals  $[0,\epsilon/2]$  and  $[\epsilon/2,1]$ . First of all, as  $f(x)$  is continuous on  $[\epsilon/2,1]$ ( $\sin(\frac{1}{x})$  is continuous on  $[\epsilon/2,1]$ ), it is integrable on this interval. We would like to show now that  $f$  is intergable on  $[0,\epsilon/2]$ . Consider the partition  $\sigma=\{0,\frac{\epsilon}{2}\}$  on  $[0,\epsilon/2]$  We have that 
 $\overline{S}_{\sigma}(f)-\underline{S}_{\sigma}(f)=\sum_{i=0}^{0}M_i(x_{i+1}-x_i)-\sum_{i=0}^{0}m_i(x_{i+1}-x_i)$  with  $M_i=\sup\{f(x):x\in[x_i,x_{i+1}]\}$  and  $m_i=\inf\{f(x):x\in[x_i,x_{i+1}]\}$ . 
 We have that  $M_i\le1$  and  $m_i\le 0$ . Thus, 
 $\sum_{i=0}^{0}M_i(x_{i+1}-x_i)-\sum_{i=0}^{0}m_i(x_{i+1}-x_i)\le1\cdot \frac{\epsilon}{2}< \epsilon$ . Therefore, as  $f(x)$  is integrable on  $[0,\epsilon/2]$  and on  $[\epsilon/2,1]$ , we conclude that  $f$  is integrable on  $[0,1]$ . 
 Now, I would like to calculate it's integral value... If someone could help with it, I would appreciate it. Honestly, I have no idea how to integrate this such of discontinuous functions at finitely many points. 
 Edit : 
 As  $f(x)$  is continuous on  $[\epsilon/3,1]$ , it is integrable on this interval. Therefore,  $\forall \epsilon>0 \ \exists$  partition  $\tau$  on the interval  $[\epsilon/3,1]$ :  $\overline{S}_{\tau}(f)-\underline{S}_{\tau}(f)<\epsilon/3$ 
 To show that  $f$  is integrable on  $[0,1]$ , we have to show that:  $\forall \epsilon>0 \ \exists$  a partition  $\sigma$ :  $\overline{S}_{\sigma}(f)-\underline{S}_{\sigma}<\epsilon$ 
 Suppose  $0<\epsilon<3$  and let  $\sigma=\tau \ \cup \{0\}$  be a partition on the interval  $[0,1]$ . We have that (for the following inequality I use the same definition for  $M_i$  and  $m_i$  as above in the post): 
 $\overline{S}_{\sigma}(f)-\underline{S}_{\sigma}=\Big(\sum_{i=0}^{0}\underbrace{M_i}_{\le1}(x_{i+1}-x_i)-\sum_{i=0}^{0}\underbrace{m_i}_{\ge -1}(x_{i+1}-x_i)\Big)+\underbrace{\Big(\sum_{i=1}^{n}M_i(x_{i+1}-x_i)-\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_i(x_{i+1}-x_i)\Big)}_{<\epsilon/3}<\frac{\epsilon}{3}+\frac{\epsilon}{3}+\frac{\epsilon}{3}=\epsilon$ .

"I'll just give you the four rules that matter in this problem and explain my thought process and the other opinion. 
 Rule #1: 15 players are playing a game. 
 Rule #2: One player (J) can secretly select a player (not themselves). 
 Rule #3: A different player (K) can then secretly select a player (not themselves) and kill them. 
 Rule #4: If J selects K, then K will be given no choice and will kill J. 
 Clarification: J and K can select the same person. 
 It is then revealed that K killed J. What is the probability that J had selected K? 
 Let Q be the required probability. 
 I will attempt to calculate the probability that J did NOT select K given that K killed J. 
 Let's call A the event {J does NOT select K} and B the event {K kills J}.  
 We're trying to calculate P(A/B), which is equal to P(AB)/P(B). Clarification: AB means A∩B. 
 P(Β) first. B can happen if J selects K (1/14), or K selects J (1/14), minus the intersection (1/196). Thus, P(B)=2/14-1/196=27/196. 
 AB now. The probability that K selects J (1/14), minus P{K selects J AND J selects K} (1/196). So, P(AB)=13/196. 
 Thus, P(A/B)=0.481481... or about 48%. And Q=0.52. Almost. 
 Some people, however, argued that since we know J died to K, the sample space only includes the events {K killed J}, of which there are 14, and only 1 of those also includes J selecting K, thus Q=1/14. Part of the argument is that P(B)=1, since we know that K killed J. 
 I am not sure wether we are looking for dependent probability or intersection. The problem, however, is perfectly defined. If it is revealed that K killed J, what are the odds of J having selected K? 
 EDIT: Another clarification: While, yes, both J and K do not have to select another player, we assume that both did (although K will kill J if he is selected, even if he doesn't want to kill anyone). 
 I was also a bit vague about what J does when he selects another player because it is irrelevant. If you must know, during the day he selects the player he wants to interrogate that night, and in all nights except the first one (which this problem examines), kill them if he so wants. There are exceptions, but this is the general rule.

 Question: 
 Let $S$ be the surface $x^2+y^2=1 ; 0 \le z \le 2;$ oriented so that the normal points from the z-axis. Calculate: 
 $$\iint\limits_S F\cdot dS;F(x,y,z)=xy^2i+x^2yj+zk;$$ 
 Answer: 
 The teacher starts out by adding a bottom $B$ and top $T$ to the cylinder, closing the surface. 
 $$\iint\limits_{S+B+T} F\cdot dS = \iiint\limits_V \nabla F dV=\iint\limits_{x^2+y^2\le1}\int_0^2(y^2+x^2+1) dzdxdy=[polar]=...=3\pi$$ 
 Now it's time to subtract $B$ and $T$ again. The teacher puts up the following two equations: 
 $$\iint\limits_B F\cdot dS=\iint\limits_{x^2+y^2\le1}F(x,y,0)\cdot (0,0,-1)dxdy= 0$$
and
$$\iint\limits_T F\cdot dS=\iint\limits_{x^2+y^2\le1}F(x,y,2)\cdot (0,0,1)dxdy= 2\pi$$ 
 I guess he's using the general Stokes (edit: this is wrong)
$$\int\limits_CF\cdot dS=\iint\limits_S \nabla F\cdot NdS$$ 
 My questions are: 
If he is using that formula, where's the $\nabla$ disappearing? Why are the normal vectors chosen in that particular way? How do I know which way is which?

 It is the red triangle in the picture. The exercise is to calculate the area of the Equilateral triangle (without using law of cosine and law of sine, just with simple elementary argumentation). 
 The first I did was to reflect point $A$ along the opposite side $a$, therefore I get $D$. Afterwards I constructed another Equilateral triangle $\triangle PP_1C$.

"Question: 
 How do you nullify (zero out) rotation around an arbitrary axis in a Quaternion? 
 Example: 
 Let's say you have an object with quaternion orientation $A$.
You also have a rotation quaternion $B$.
You can calculate a new quaternion orientation $C=BA$. 
 Let's say the new orientation $C$, if done with axis-angle rotations, is equivalent to a 45 degree rotation around the arrow's local y-axis, followed by a 45 degree rotation around the arrow's local x-axis (which was moved due to the rotation around the y-axis). 
 In other words, imagine our 3D coordinate frame as a cube. Now imagine the initial orientation $A$ as an arrow in the center of our cube, facing in the negative-z direction. It's pointing at the center of the face of the cube whose normal is in the negative-z direction (with all normals pointing  out  of the cube). 
 Now, if we rotate this arrow 45 degrees around its local y-axis, it would be pointing at an edge of the cube. If we rotate it again, this time around its local x-axis, it would then be pointing at a corner of the cube. 
 The rotations described above can be encoded in a single Quaternion. A specific example of my question is, how can we alter that Quaternion so that it zeros out the rotation around, say, the x-axis, leaving only the rotation around the y-axis (meaning, in the end it would be pointing at an edge of the cube, not the corner)? 
 My full question is, how can we alter a Quaternion so that it zeros out the rotation around an arbitrary axis? 
 Remember of course that in general we would not know how the Quaternion was made, meaning we wouldn't know that it represents $a$ degrees around the x-axis, $b$ degrees around the y-axis, and $c$ degrees around the z-axis.

"I am struggling to understand the formula for compound interest. More specifically what the  $n$  stands for. 
 The formula is as follows according to the  wikipedia :
 $$
A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}
$$ 
 Where 
 $A$  = final amount 
 $P$   = initial principal balance (money invested) 
 $r$   = interest rate 
 $n$   = number of times interest applied per time period 
 $t$   = number of time periods elapsed 
 But we can twist the parameters so that the interest is not  $r$ . 
 Let's take an example: annual interest rate of 20%, compounded quarterly. This means that the parameters are  $t = 1$  year,  $r = 20$ %,  $n = 4$ 
 If I invest 1 USD for a year ( $P = 1$ ) it should be 1.20 USD at the end of the year by the definition of annual interest rate, but based on the formula, I calculate something different: The annual interest rate is  $21.55$ %, because by investing 1 USD, I will have earned 1.2155 USD by the end of the year. 
 $$
A = 1(1 + \frac{0.2}{4})^{4 \cdot 1} = 1.21550625
$$ 
Which is approximately 21.55%, not 20% annually. 
 The continuous compounding interest is derived from this formula, so I would like to understand this before understanding that.

"Given some upper bound $n$ is there an efficient way to calculate the following: 
 $$\sum_{i=1}^n \varphi(i) $$ 
 I am aware that: 
 $$\sum_{i=1}^n \varphi(i) = \frac 12 \left( 1+\sum_{i=1}^n \mu(i) \left \lfloor \frac ni \right\rfloor ^2 \right) $$ 
 Where: 
$\varphi(x) $ is  Euler's Totient 
$\mu(x) $ is the  Möbius function   
 I'm wondering if there is a way to reduce the problem to simpler computations because my upper bound on will be very large, ie: $n \approx 10^{11} $.

 $$

I thought maybe they meant to compute the  $u$  for the  $\sigma=\sqrt {50}$ , but this is not the same answer as the one the book gives.

"I just had an interesting conversation with my kid who asked an innocent question about the $\pi$:   
 
 If $\pi$ is infinite - does that mean that somewhere in it there's another $\pi$? 
 
 I looked around and found  this question  and a few other, similar ones but I'm afraid my math knowledge is a bit limited to draw a definitive conclusion to the above question.   
 Further conversation yielded a secondary question:   
 
 Is there a place within $\pi$ where the  complete  previous set of numbers (starting with the $3.14...$) repeats all the way to the beginning of that repetition set?   
 
 This question seems rather tricky to me as my assumption is that such a set should exist (because the set is infinite, so the probability of such set's existence should be non-$0$, right?) but the longer we ""wait"" for such a repetition to occur the longer that repeated set should be, which makes the ""wait"" longer... and I'm falling into a recursion here :)   
 In addition the fact that $\pi$ is irrational means there are no repeatable sequences of digits in it (if my understanding is correct) which kind of throws off the whole ""such a sequence should exist since the series is infinite"" logic. 
 An extension to the second question is:   
 
 Is it possible to calculate the probability of such a subset's existence (the one that repeats all the previously seen numbers in the exact same sequence) and if so - what would that probability be?

 Besides, I think the algorithm needs not to be deterministic, but with high probability is enough.

 $$I=\int{ \frac{2dz} {  (z-(2-i)) \cdot (z-\frac{(2-i)}{5}) } }$$  where  $|z|=1$  is the contour. 
 Thefore, using the Residue formula over the closed contour  $|z|=1$  gives us:

Given this, we know that we know that the total area is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the triangle.  
 We have both the height, and the width needed to calculate the area of the rectangle 
 Area rectangle = 1/4 · 3 = 3/4

 The only thing I did is set  $a_n = \frac{1}{k^k}$  but it didn't really help because it's way less than the original question's series, by a couple of magnitudes... ( $e^k$  to be exact)

"I'm trying to calculate the distance between two geodetic points in two different ways.
The points are: 
 A:(41.466138, 15.547839)
B:(41.467216, 15.547025)
 
 The distance between the two points is pretty small (about 130/140 meters) 
 1) I have used the Haversine forumla that using  this site  gives me the following result: 
 
 So the mesured distance using the Haversine formula is 137,7 meters. 
 2) I have tried to calculate the distance transformating the geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude) in cartesian coordinates (x, y). I have calculated the (x,y) coordinates for A and B: 
 R =  6371; //radius of the earth
X = R * Math.cos(lat) * Math.cos(lon); // lon and lat are in radiants (which is not the same as provided above, must multiply by Pi / 180)
Y = R * Math.cos(lat) * Math.sin(lon);
 
 So I obtained: 
 A: (4599,392641683213, 1279,6610297820203)
B: (4599,334350798723, 1279,574411410788)
 
 NOTE: It assumes that the altitude is negligible in A and B. 
 Now that I have the cartesian coordinates I can calculate the distance using Pitagora's theorem, so: 
 |Xb - Xa| = 4599,392641683213 - 4599,334350798723 = 0,05829 Km
|Yb - Ya| = 1279,6610297820203 - 1279,574411410788 = 0,08662 Km

distanceAB = sqrt(0,05829^2 + 0,08662^2) = 0,1044 Km = 104,4 m
 
 As you can see the distance calculated with the above methods generate different values: 
 137,7 m for with the former, 104,4 m with the latter.

fix a particular point $x_0 ∈ X$, that is

 (ii) Now consider the case $X = C$. Choose a corner $c_0$ of the cube $C$ and consider
the subset H of $G$ which fixes the point at $c_0$. By considering the symmetries of
the cube, identify the order of this subgroup. 
 The question goes on to ask what do the cosets of $H$ in $G$ represent and then by using Lagrange calculate the order of $G$.  
 My question is this. I was under the impression that the symmetry group of the cube had 48 elements and was isomorphic to $S_4\times \Bbb Z_2$ after a meeting with my lecturer today he told me this assumption was overly simplistic and that in fact there were 8! elements in G as in the case of $S_8$ and that it was not isomorphic to $S_4 \times \Bbb Z_2$ because this didn't have enough elements.

 He states: 
 
 We have been looking to find the arc length of the curve  $y = a sin x$

 The exact value is: 
 $π ∫ √ (1 + a^2 cos^2 x ) dx$

 However, a good estimate can be found (to 2-3 decimal places) with the polynomial: 
 $y = .0081196317102889 x^4 - .11577326164517 x^3 + .63914882375794 x^2 + .2071162669684 x + 3.0881429428239$ 
 
 I'm having trouble understanding how that polynomial works though.  Arc length of the sine wave will vary both with amplitude and frequency of the sine wave, right? I don't see a way to accommodate for that.

"The problem is stated as: 
 
 Calculate  $f^{(n)}(0)$  where  $f(x) = e^{x^2}$  and  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ 
 
 Attempt: 
 We know that  $e^{x} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{k!}x^k +\frac{x^{n+1}e^{\theta x}}{(n+1)!}$  for some  $\theta = \theta (x) \in (0,1)$ 
 Hence,  $e^{x^2}=\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{k!}x^{2k} +\frac{x^{2n+1}e^{\theta x^2}}{(n+1)!}$ 
 Comparing terms with the general Maclaurin polynomial, we get that: 
 $\frac{1}{k!}x^{2k} = \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^{n}$ 
 First, we have to equate the exponent of the  $x$  - terms, so  $2k = n \iff k = n/2$ 
 Therefore, we have that: 
 $\Rightarrow f^{n}(0) = \frac{n!}{(n/2)!}$ 
 However, since we had natural numbers in our expression, I wonder what would happen if  $n$  was odd in this case. How could I generalize this even further?

"I've got a conceptual problem regarding inward and outward normals. The textbook question (2nd year vector calculus) is as follows: 
 
 A uniform fluid that flows vertically downward is described by the vector field  $\mathbf F(x,y,z) = -\mathbf k$ . Find the flux through the cone  $z = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \ , \ \ \ x^2+y^2\le1$ 
 
 So I've parametrised the surface in cylindrical coordinates as  $$\Phi(\rho,\phi) = (\rho\cos(\phi),\rho\sin(\phi),\rho)$$  with  $0\le\rho\le 1$  and  $0\le\phi\le2\pi$ 
 Then
 $$\vec {\mathbf T_\rho} = (\cos(\phi),\sin(\phi),1)
\\ \vec {\mathbf T_\phi} = (-\rho\sin(\phi),\rho\cos(\phi),0)$$ 
 $$\vec {\mathbf T_\rho} \ \ \times \ \ \vec {\mathbf T_\phi} =  
\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf i & \mathbf j &\mathbf k \\ 
                 \cos(\phi) & \sin(\phi) & 1 \\
                 -\rho\sin(\phi) & \rho\cos(\phi) & 0
    \end{vmatrix} \\ = \ (-\rho\cos(\phi), -\rho\sin(\phi), \rho)
$$ 
 But then I try to calculate  $$\iint_s \mathbf F \cdot \mathrm d \mathbf s \\ = \int_{0}^1 \int_{0}^{2\pi} (0,0,-1) \ \cdot \ (-\rho\cos(\phi), -\rho\sin(\phi), \rho) \ \mathrm d\phi \ \mathrm d\rho \\ = \int_{0}^1 \int_{0}^{2\pi} -\rho \ \mathrm d\phi \mathrm d\rho \\ = \int_0^1 -2\pi\rho \ \mathrm d\rho \\ = -\pi$$ 
 which is the negative of the actual answer of  $\pi$ . I've got a feeling it's to do with the order of the cross product so my question is: 
 
 How can I fix this problem, and why is it that I should take the reverse cross product?

 Calculate 
 $$g(z)=\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{\frac{1}{4}}}{x^3+1} \, dx$$ 
 Now, i recognise this as an integral of the type
 $$\int_0^\infty x^{\alpha-1} f(x) \, dx$$  which we can move into the complex plane with  $f$  is a rational function such that  $f(\mathbb{R}) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ .  $g$  is analytic on  $\mathbb{C}$  with the exception of the finite points  $\{-1, \frac{1-i\sqrt{3}}{2},\frac{1+i\sqrt{3}}{2}\}$  none of which are in  $[0,\infty)$  and  $a \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Z}$  (it's obvious to see that  $a = \frac{5}{4}$ 
now we assume that there exists constants  $R>0,M_1>0 \text{ and } \delta_1>0$  such that
 $$|f(z)z^{\alpha-1}|\leq \frac{M_1}{|z|^{1+\delta_1}},~|z|>R, \tag 1
$$  
and constants  $r>0,M_2>0 \text{ and } \delta_2>0$  such
 $$|f(z)z^{\alpha-1}| \leq M_2|z|^{\delta_2-1}, \tag 2$$ 
now we consider
 $$z^{\alpha - 1}=z^{\frac{1}{4}}$$  and  $$f(z) = \frac{1}{z^3+1}$$ 
 then the conditions of (1) and (2) works out to be, does
 $$\frac{z^{\frac{5}{4}}}{z^3+1} \longrightarrow 0$$ 
as  $z \longrightarrow 0$  and  $z \longrightarrow \infty$ 
obviously as  $z$  tends to zero we have  $0,$  and  $z^3$  outpaces  $z^{\frac{5}{4}}$  and so we have  $0$  on both accounts. 
 now....on to the integral.
 $$\int_0^\infty \frac{z^{\frac{5}{4}}}{z^3+1} \, dz = \frac{2 \pi i}{1-e^{\frac{\pi i}{2} }}\left[ \operatorname{Res} \left(z^{\frac{1}{4}}f(z),-1\right) + \operatorname{Res} \left(z^{\frac{1}{4}}f(z),\frac{1-i\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \operatorname{Res} \left(z^{\frac{1}{4}}f(z),\frac{1+i\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)\right]-\frac{\left(\int_{S^{-}_{\epsilon}(0)} f(z) z^{\frac{1}{4}}+\int_{S^{+}_{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}(0)} f(z) z^{\frac{1}{4}}\right)}{1-e^{\frac{\pi i}{2}}}$$ 
 now from my understanding this is the correct integral, i need to consider it as  $\epsilon \longrightarrow 0$ , now...one major issue i'm having is that i'm not understanding what the contour is in this instance, normally for  $\pm \infty$  we just consider the upper half plane...are we considering only a single quarter in this instance?

"Let $Z\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Let  $X$ be a random variable defined as $X:=ZI_{Z>0}$, where $I_{Z>0}$ is an indicator random variable for the event $\{Z>0\}$. How do I find $\mathbb{E}[X]$? 
 Here's my attempt.  
 Let $\Omega$ be the sample space on which $Z$ is defined. The random variable $X$ is a product of two random variables, $Z$ and $I_{Z>0}$. We thus have $$X(\omega)=Z(\omega)\cdot I_{Z>0}(\omega)=\begin{cases}Z(\omega)\quad\text{if }Z(\omega)>0\\ \\ 0\quad\text{ if }Z(\omega)\le 0\end{cases}$$
Thus, the range of $X$ is $\{0\}\cup\mathbb{R^+}=[0,\infty)$. 
 We have $$\mathbb{P}(X=0)=\mathbb{P}(Z\le 0)=1/2$$
and $$\mathbb{P}(X\le x)=\begin{cases}0\quad\text{if }x<0\\\frac{1}{2}\quad\text{if }x=0\\\frac{1}{2}+\mathbb{P}(0\le Z\le x)\quad\text{if }x>0\end{cases}$$ 
 But $\mathbb{P}(0\le Z\le x)=\Phi(x)-\Phi(0)=\Phi(x)-\frac{1}{2}$, where $\Phi$ is the CDF of $Z$. 
 We therefore have
$$\mathbb{P}(X\le x)=\begin{cases}0\quad\text{if }x<0\\\frac{1}{2}\quad\text{if }x=0\\\Phi(x)\quad\text{if }x>0\end{cases}$$. 
 I have studied that $\mathbb{E}[Y]=\sum_{y}y\mathbb{P}(Y=y)$ if $Y$ is discrete, and $\mathbb{E}[Y]=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_Y(y)\mathrm{d}y$ if $Y$ is a continuous r.v. But I am not able to figure out what type of random variable $X$ is. In my understanding, $X$ cannot be continuous since $\mathbb{P}(X=0)=1/2\neq 0$, and $X$ cannot be discrete either since the range of $X$ is uncountable. How do I calculate $\mathbb{E}[X]$?

"Problem 
 If you invest a dollar at “ $6\%$  interest compounded monthly,” it amounts to  $(1.005)^n$  dollars after  $n$  months. If you invest  $\$10$  at the beginning of each month for  $10$  years ( $120$  months), how much will you have at the end of the  $10$  years? 
 [ Source :  Mary Boas  Mathematical Method in the Physical Sciences   $3$ Ed:  $1.1.13$ ] 
 My Understanding 
 It's a monthly compound interest problem where you start with  $\$10$  with a interest rate of  $6\%$  and every month you invest an additional  $\$10$ . The question asks to find the final amount after  $10$  years of investing ( $120$  months). 
 I am confused after looking at the  solution manual 
 It takes the sum of the series
 $$S=10(1.005)+10(1.005)^2+10(1.005)^3+...10(1.005)^{120}$$  and uses the partial sum formula for the geometric series to calculate the sum as  $1646.99$ 
 When I was solving the problem, my series wasn't geometric:
 $$S=10(1.005) + (10(1.005)+10)1.005 + ((10(1.005)+10)1.005)1.005+...$$ 
which simplifies to
 $$10(1.005+(1.005^2+1.005)+(1.005^3+1.005^2+1.005)+...)$$ 
 I have two questions. 
 
 Why it is the case the solution represents this problem with a geometric series if  $a$ , the initial amount, alters due to the additional  $\$10$  investment each month. 
 Is there a formula to calculating the sum of the series I wrote?

 Now I know that $P(T_1 > t) = \exp(-\int_0^t \lambda(s) ds) = \exp(-2t)$. So the density would be given by $g_1(t) = 2\exp(-2t) $.

 For the  Descomposition Theorem of Chromatic Polynomials . if G=(V,E), is a connected graph and e belong E

 When calculating chromatic Polynomials, i shall place brackets about a graph to indicate its chromatic polynomial. removes an edge any of the original graph to calculate the chromatic polynomial by the method of decomposition.

"I was doing a little trigonometry challenge given by my professor, which is not anything especially complicated. However, it is completely based on getting the area of the green triangle in relation to the side of the square and the triangle, equal to $x$. 
 Reference image:    
 I've already got a bit of data from some trig. relations. What doesn't seem to be doable is finding a relation between $x$ and the sides $L_1$ and $L_2$ or isolating the sine of $\beta$ from the area of that triangle, in relation to $x$ as well. 
 Anyway, the following is the data gathered so far. 
 
 Sine of $\alpha$ (both $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$):
$$ \begin{aligned}
h_1^2 &= x^2 + \frac{x^2}{4} = \frac{5x^2}{4} \\
h_1 &= \frac{x \sqrt{5}}{2}
\end{aligned} \\
\begin{aligned}
\sin {\alpha} &= \frac{x}{h_1} = \frac{x}{\frac{x \sqrt{5}}{2}} = \frac{2x}{x \sqrt 5} = \frac{2}{\sqrt 5} = \frac{2 \sqrt 5}{5}
\end{aligned} $$ 
 Relation between sides $L_1$ and $L_2$, as well as sine of $\beta$ (through the law of sines):
$$ \begin{aligned}
\frac{\sin \alpha}{L_2} &= \frac{\sin \beta}{\frac{x}{2}} = \frac{\sin 30^\circ}{L_1} \\
\frac{2 \sqrt 5}{5L_2} &= \frac{2 \sin \beta}{x} = \frac{1}{2L_1}
\end{aligned} \\ 
\begin{aligned}
L_1 &= \frac{L_2 \sqrt 5}{4} = \frac{x}{4 \sin \beta} \\
L_2 &= \frac{4L_1 \sqrt 5}{5} = \frac{x \sqrt 5}{5 \sin \beta}
\end{aligned} $$ 
 Relation between $h_2$ and sides $L_1$ and $L_2$:
$$ \begin{aligned}
\sin \alpha = \frac{2 \sqrt 5}{5} &= \frac{h_2}{L_1} \\
\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} &= \frac{h_2}{L_2}
\end{aligned} \\
\begin{aligned}
h_2 &= \frac{L_2}{2} = \frac{2L_1 \sqrt 5}{5} = L_1 \sin \alpha
\end{aligned} $$ 
 Calculating the area with the data so far (1) (using sine of $\beta$):
$$ \begin{aligned}
A &= \frac{\frac{x}{2} \cdot L_1 \sin \alpha}{2} \\
&= \frac{x}{4} \cdot L_1 \sin \alpha \\
&= \frac{x}{4} \cdot \frac{x}{4 \sin \beta} \sin \alpha \\
&= \frac{x^2}{16} \cdot \frac{\sin \alpha}{\sin \beta}
\end{aligned} $$ 
 Calculating the area with the data so far (2) (using the sides' values)
$$ \begin{aligned}
A &= \frac{\frac{x}{2} \cdot \frac{2L_1 \sqrt 5}{5}}{2} \\
&= \frac{x \sqrt 5}{5} \cdot \frac{L_1}{2} \\
&= \frac{x \sqrt 5}{5} \cdot \frac{L_2 \sqrt 5}{8} \\
&= x \cdot \frac{L_2}{8}
\end{aligned} $$ 
 
 Additionally, I've tried assuming (for the sake of an approximation) that $\beta$ is a right angle, since it is roughly equal to 86 degrees, and applied a theorem I've noticed in right triangles while meddling with this challenge. 
 
 Given a triangle $\Delta ABC$, where $a = BC$, $b = CA$ and $c = AB$, the height $h$ of the triangle, perpendicular to the base (assumed to be AB), is equal to the product of the product of the cathetuss divided by the hypotenuse. That is,
$$ \begin{aligned}
h = \frac{a \cdot b}{c}.
\end{aligned} $$ 
 Moreover, with a substitution of these values, it is possible to get the value of the sides from $x$, as well as confirm the angle of $\beta$.
$$ \begin{aligned}
h_2 &= \frac{2L_1L_2}{x} \\
&= \frac{L_2}{2} = L_1 \sin \alpha 
\end{aligned} \\
L_1 = \frac{x}{4},\ L_2 = \frac{x \sqrt 5}{5} \\
x = 4L_1 = L_2 \sqrt 5 \\
\sin \beta = \sin 90^\circ = 1
$$ 
 And finally, calculate an estimated approximation for the area, either with the value of $\beta$ or the value of the sides in respect to $x$.
$$ \begin{align}
A &= \frac{x^2}{16} \cdot \frac{\sin \alpha}{\sin \beta} \\
&= \frac{x^2}{16} \cdot \frac{2 \sqrt 5}{5} \\
&= \frac{2x^2 \sqrt 5}{80} = \frac{x^2 \sqrt 5}{40} \\ \newline
A &= x \cdot \frac{L_2}{2} \\
&= x \cdot \frac{ \frac{x \sqrt 5}{5} }{8} \\
&= x \cdot \frac{x \sqrt 5}{40} = \frac{x^2 \sqrt 5}{40} \\
\end{align} $$ 
 
 How one would come to derive $x$ into the sides' values or the sine of $\beta$, in order to get the area only through $x$? What sort of hindsight is required to do so, even?

 Calculate (i.e. express without using infinite sum):  
 $$\frac{1}{1!\cdot1}+\frac{2}{2!\cdot2}+\frac{4}{4!\cdot4}+\frac{8}{6!\cdot8}+..$$ 
 
 In sum it would be:

 But now I somehow need to get rid off the sum symbol because the task clearly asks for an expression without it :P 
 But how can I remove the sum symbol? Two things come to my mind: Derivation and taylor-formula. But how to use derivation here if we got factorial... How use taylor if there isn't a point given (that one where you analyze at), and also it requires derivative as well... ^^

 So given is the sequence: $b_{n} = \frac{1-2n}{\sqrt{n^{2}+1} + \sqrt{n^{2}+2n}}$.
  We know that its limit is $-1$. Now I'm supposed to prove that it's
  bounded series. 
 
 To show it's bounded, we take the limit $-1$ and equalize it with $b_{n}$ and calculate $n$. Then check if $n$ is lower(-equal) or greater(-equal) $-1$: 
 $$\frac{1-2n}{\sqrt{n^{2}+1} + \sqrt{n^{2}+2n}} = -1$$ 
 $$\frac{(1-2n)^{2}}{(n^{2}+1)+(n^{2}+2n)} = 1$$ 
 $$\frac{(1-2n)^{2}}{2n^{2}+2n+1} = 1$$ 
 $$(1-2n)^{2} = 2n^{2}+2n+1$$ 
 $$4n^{2}-4n+1 = 2n^{2}+2n+1$$ 
 $$0 = 2n^{2}-6n$$ 
 $$0 = n(2n-6)$$ 
 $n_{1} = -3 < -1 \Rightarrow$ upper bound 
 $n_{2} = 0 > -1 \Rightarrow$ lower bound

"I'm not a mathematician, I'm only a programmer with not so good math skills trying to implement something that need this math.
Imagining that somehow a sequence of numbers where given to you, randomly, and while been generated they are summed (through a function, anyway) in a manner that after all you have only the total and you can enter an index (the order or position) and is returned what number was summed in that position. 
 Ex.:
The computer generated randomly the numbers [6, 45,97,12, 26] and summed through this magical function and returned 186 (or other result). Now, with this result I can enter 4 and the algorithm  will return the value 12, because the fourth number added was 12. 
 Are there some way I can calculate this? 
 Please, be nice with that symbols. 
 Edit. 
 What I'm trying to says is that, when you add numbers, due to the distributive aspects you can not retrieve the exact same numbers you added. If you have 4 + 8, the result, 12, can be expressed as 8+4, 6+6, 4+4+4, 2+10, etc. But if you have only the result you will never know what the original numbers generated the result. To me, the final result doesn't matter that much since I have some way to make a math operation with may sequence of numbers and having the result and the formula I can search for the original elements of the computation with the original order. Imagine you need to send a message, a sequence of numbers, and your receiver not only need to have the original numbers, but he needs to be able to look the number in the position it was added, without the need of reveal all the number at once, but see the given number in the exact order it was added or the operation he needs to do will fail, the message will not be correct.
So you have thousands of numbers, randomly generated, and you need to transmit, but your receiver will not get thousands of numbers, he needs to get one or two number and a key (the formula) with wich he is able to search, say, he needs to look the numbers added (or processed any way) in the position 637 to the 856 in a moment, so he will get the sum, inform the position he needs and the result will be the number added in that position.
I saying sum, but is a formula, some way to take number in a specific order, compute, get a result and with the result be able to look what was placed in a specific position.

"I have been thinking of a problem that I cannot solve by myself. I would really appretiate any help. Let's assume I am studying a bus line in one (and only one) direction, with  $n$  stops numbered 1 to 4 (for example): 
     1      2      3      4
    o ---> o ---> o ---> o
 
 I could represent the trips on the bus line as a matrix: 
 $$
\begin{matrix}
 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
1 & 0 & t_{12} & t_{13} & t_{14} \\
2 & 0 & 0 & t_{23} & t_{24} \\
3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & t_{34} \\
4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{matrix}
$$ 
 Since the bus line is one direction only, no one can go in the oposite direction, and it doesn't make sense to board and alight on the same stop, so the diagonal and the bottom triangle should all be 0. There can be any number of trips:  $t_{12}$  is any natural number ( $\mathbb{N}$ ). It doesn't make sense to have a negative, fractional or real number of trips. 
 I can calculate the total number of boardings and alightings at each stop, as they are just the rows and columns totals (respectively): 
 $$ Boardings_i = \sum_{j=1}^4 t_{ij}$$ 
 $$ Alightings_i = \sum_{i=1}^4 t_{ij}$$ 
 Everyone getting on the bus should get down at some point, so total boardings must equal total alightings: 
 $$ \sum_{i=1}^4 B_i = \sum_{i=1}^4 A_i $$ 
 Now, let's assume I know this totals for rows and columns (the number of people boarding and alighting on each stop),  $(B_i, A_i) \in \mathbb{N}$  , and I want to find a matrix ( $t_{ij}$ ) that produces these totals.  How many matrices are there that add up to these row and column totals? 
 I have tried to develop an intuition for this. I know the solution is trivial for  $n = 2$ , and there is one and only one solution for  $n = 3$ , as I can express the problem as a system of linear equations: 
 \begin{align}
B_1 & = t_{12} + t_{13} \\
B_2 & = t_{23} \\
A_2 & = t_{12} \\
A_3 & = t_{13} + t_{23} \\
B_1 + B_2 & = A_2 + A_3 \\
\end{align} 
 I am stuck there. I know for  $n = 4$  the number of possible solutions depend on the total number of trips. For higher values of  $(B_i, A_i)$ , I should expect a higher number of solutions possible. Except the matrix structure counts: there is only one valid solution for  $B_i = [x, x, x, 0], A_i=[0, x, x, x]$ , regardless of the value of x. Specifically, high values in the right-top matrix cells  $(t_{13}, t_{14}, t_{24})$  seem produce higher number of possible solutions (degrees of freedom?),  $t_{12}$  and  $t_{34}$  seem to reduce the number of posible solutions, while other matrix cells next to the diagonal (e.g.  $t_{23}$ ) seem to provide no information / have no effect because their values are determined from other matrix cells. For example: 
 
 $B_i = [8, 4, 2, 0], A_i=[0, 0, 6, 8]$  allows for 5 different matrices resulting in the given row and column totals 
 $B_i = [8, 5, 1, 0], A_i=[0, 0, 6, 8]$  allows for 6 different matrices resulting in the given row and column totals 
 $B_i = [8, 6, 0, 0], A_i=[0, 0, 6, 8]$  allows for 7 different matrices resulting in the given row and column totals 
 
 Any guidance on how to tackle this is much appretiated. Any tips on how to generalize the solution to  $ n > 4 $  are also much appretiated.

"If $X$ and $Y$ are independent uniform random variables over $[0,1]$, what is the density function of the variable $Z=\frac{X}{X+Y}$? I got the following result: 
 $$f_Z(z) =

\frac{z^2}{2(1-z)^2}, & \text{if } 0 \le z \le \frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{1}{2}, & \text{if } \frac{1}{2} < z \le 1 \\ 
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$ 
 My method is as follows: I first write $Z=\frac{1}{1+Y/X}$, and then I calculate the probability function of $\frac{Y}{X}$, and this can be found  here . And then I calculate $Z$'s domain and density function according to the domain and density function of $\frac{Y}{X}$ (i.e., let $W=\frac{Y}{X}$, and you can get $W=\frac{1}{Z}-1$, and substitute this into $W$'s domain and density function, you can get $Z$'s). For your convenience, the density function of $W$ is as follows:
$$f_W(w) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2}, & \text{if } 0 \le w \le 1 \\
\frac{1}{2w^2}, & \text{if } w > 1 \\ 
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$ 
 However, when I use Python to generate 100000 samples of $Z$ to test the result, I get the following graph, which contradicts with the density function of $f_Z(z)$ (the $z>0.5$ part).  
 The code is as follows:

"So, here's a question asked in an interview: 
 
 10 dices are rolled simultaneously. What is the probability of getting the sum of numbers appearing on top of all the dice as 35? 
 
 If we calculate manually, I think it's pretty tedious with no calculators allowed. So, I thought of approximating the answer. We know that rolling  $10$  dice, has total number of ways as  $6^{10}$  which is ~ $ 1e7$  which makes it ideal for using a normal distribution. So, mean of  $10$  throws is  $35$  and SD of 10 throws is ~ $ 5.4$  and so  $Z = \dfrac{(X-35)}{5.4}$  and so we want  $P(\leq35) - P(\leq34)$  as my answer,  $P(\leq35) = 1/2$  and the other one can be obtained from the Normal graph and hence, we have the answer. 
 But to my surprise, the interviewer didn't seem convinced! Is there something wrong with my method? Please point out. Thanks!

"This exercise can be found in  an introduction to homological algebra  by  C.A. Weibel . 
 
 Use the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex to show that $$H_3(\mathfrak{sl}_2,k) \cong H^3(\mathfrak{sl}_2,k) \cong k$$ where for simplicity $k$ is a field of characteristic $0$ and as usual, $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ denotes the space of traceless matrices in $k$. 
 
 I am only interested in the cohomological case, i.e. showing that $$H^3(\mathfrak{sl}_2,k) \cong k.$$ However, I am quite lost. I mean, the best way is to use the definitions, so we have the complex $$ \mathrm{Hom}_k(\Lambda^2\mathfrak{sl}_2,k) \overset{d}{\to} \mathrm{Hom}_k(\Lambda^3\mathfrak{sl}_2,k) \overset{d}{\to} \mathrm{Hom}_k(\Lambda^4\mathfrak{sl}_2,k)$$ where $$\begin{align*}df(x_1,\dots,x_{n + 1}) =& \sum_i (-1)^{i +1}x_if(x_1,\dots,\hat{x_i},\dots,x_{n + 1})\\
&+\sum_{i < j}(-1)^{i + j}f([x_i,x_j],x_+,\dots,\hat{x_i},\dots,\hat{x_j},\dots,x_{n + 1})\end{align*}$$ 
 Also, I do know a basis of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, so it should be enough to calculate the above on basis elements. Am I right? How would one proceed to calculate the cohomology? 
 Edit.  This is for a short presentation of cohomology of Lie algebras at my university and thus I cannot introduce other terminology than the main onces (it was a course about Lie algebras and Lie groups). Since the topic before covers Hochschild-Serre spectral sequences and things like that  I am not even sure if it is possible to calculate the homology only using the definition and some linear algebra .

"I am trying to calculate a loan amount where the total principle depends on the payment amount. 
 Here's a simple example, leaving aside that a) no bank would actually do this, and b) my income is not specified: 
 I have  $0  in the bank right now. I want to take out a loan for a  $100  car, for which I will be making a regular annual payment, starting at the end of year 0 with an interest-only payment. My loan rate is 5%. In order to qualify for the loan, the bank wants to make sure that I have a balance equal to twice my annual payment amount throughout the life of the loan. 
 If I borrow exactly  $100 , my payment at the end of year 0 would be  $5  ( $100  x  5% ). However, I need to borrow a little extra so that I have a  $10  balance in the account (to satisfy the requirement that I maintain a balance of twice my annual payment). This means I actually need a loan of  $110 . However, a loan of  $110  actually raises my payment amount to  $5.50 , which means I need to maintain a balance of  $11  in my account. 
 This means that I actually need to borrow  $111  to begin with, which raises my payment to  $5.55 , which means I actually need to borrow  $111.10 , etc. 
 I have worked it out to a summation that resembles the following, although I can't be certain this is accurate: 
 $$\sum_{n=1}^x (x-1-n)r^n$$ 
 Where $r$ is the interest rate 
 I believe this would allow for me to iterate $x$ number of times over a formula that sums the additional principle needed for each incremental amount of interest. However, I'm not sure how to carry this out to infinity. 
 Ultimately, I need to plug this into Excel as part of a cash flow, but I wanted to think through the math first.

 The task is to calculate these matrices: $(CA^{-1})$ and $(A^{-1}B)$. 
 In my textbook there is a hint. According to the author we should calculate $(A^T|C^T)$ to gain $X^{T}=(CA^{-1})^{T}$. Then it should be easy to convert back to $(CA^{-1})$.  
 Regarding $(A^{-1}B)$ there is a hint: ""Use $(A|B)$."" 
 I tried to use these hints a while ago and both worked well. The problem is that I do not know why I used it. Can you please explain to me this procedure?

 Why does $z\mapsto \exp(-z^2)$ have an antiderivative on $\mathbb C$? 
 
 So far I have seen the following results: 
 
 If $f\colon U\to\mathbb C$ has an antiderivative $F$ on $U$ then $\displaystyle\int_\gamma f(z)~\mathrm dz=F(\gamma(b))-F(\gamma(a))$ along a smooth curve $\gamma\colon[a,b]\to\mathbb C$. 
 If $f$ has an antiderivative then $\displaystyle\int_\gamma f(z)~\mathrm dz$ depends only on the start and end point of the curve $\gamma$. 
 If $f$ has an antiderivative, then $\displaystyle\oint_\gamma f(z)~\mathrm dz=0$ for all closed curves $\gamma$. 
 
 My problem is that I could use those results to show a function has no antiderivative (like $1/z$ yielding $2\pi\mathrm i\neq 0$ on $\partial B_r(0)$) but I am unsure what might work the other way round. What might be useful here in terms of complex analysis? 
 
 EDIT 
 There is a follow-up question based on the problem above. 
 
 Use the result from above to calculate 
 $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty\exp(-x^2-\mathrm ikx)\,\mathrm dx, k\in\mathbb R.$$ 
 
 I guess something constructive like GEdgar's suggestion might be useful here, isn't it? 
 
 EDIT 2 
 Here is my solution for the follow-up question 
 $$
\begin{align*}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp(-x^2-\mathrm ikx)\,\mathrm dx
&= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp(-(x^2+\mathrm ikx))\,\mathrm dx \\
&= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left(-\left(x^2+\mathrm ikx-\frac{k^2}{4}+\frac{k^2}{4}\right)\right)\,\mathrm dx \\
&= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left(-\left(\left(x+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm ik\right)^2+\frac{k^2}{4}\right)\right)\,\mathrm dx \\
&= \exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4}\right)\int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left(-\left(x+\frac{1}{2}  \mathrm ik\right)^2\right)\,\mathrm dx \\
&= \exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4}\right)\int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp(-t^2)\,\mathrm dt \\
&= \exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{4}\right)\sqrt{\pi}

 Find the volume bounded by the $xy$ plane, cylinder $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ and sphere $x^2 + y^2 +z^2 = 4$. 
 
 I am struggling with setting up the bounds of integration.  
First, I will calculate the 'first-quadrant' piece of the volume.

$x$ should start from the cylinder and go to the edge of the current circle of the sphere:

 QUESTION:  Let  $f$  be a continuous function from  $\Bbb{R}$  to  $\Bbb{R}$  (where  $\Bbb{R}$  is the set of all real numbers) that satisfies the following property: 
 
 
 For every natural number  $n$ ,  $f(n) =$  the smallest prime factor of  $n.$  For example,  $f(12) = 2, f(105) = 3.$  Calculate the following- 
 
 
 $(a)\lim_{x→∞}f(x)$ 
 
 
 $(b)$  The number of solutions to the equation  $f(x) = 2016$ . 
 
 
 MY SOLUTION:  I do not have a problem in understanding part  $(a)$ . Clearly,  $\infty$  is  not  a number and we cannot find any smallest prime factor for it. Or we can also argue that for  any   even  number- 
 $f(even)=2$ 
 And for  any   odd  number it depends on the  type  of the odd number.. in case it's prime then  $f(prime \space x)=x$  and in case it's  not  prime then the answer is something else.. 
 Anyway, we find that there are numerous possibilities and since all of these possibilities  directly depend  on the number we have chosen so, we cannot account for what happens in the case of  $\infty$ . 
 Coming to the second part, the question itself bounced over my head. Let's see carefully what it says- 
 We know,  $f(x)=$  the smallest prime factor of  $x$ .  Therefore,  $f(x)=2016$  must imply (by the same logic that)- 
 The smallest prime factor of  $x$  is  $2016$ . 
 Wait. What?! Firstly, 2016 is  not  prime. So how can I account for  $x's$  which have such an impossible prime factor.. secondly, even  if  we  assume  that  $2016$   is  the smallest factor of  $x$  there are infinite  $x's$  which satisfies such a property. Our answer in that case is not bounded (although it's nowhere mentioned it should be).. 
 So what does the second part even mean?  
 Thank you in advance for your kind help :).

 By the way, if we define the matrix $\mathbf{A}_n=[a_{ij}^n]_{\forall\,i,j}$ as follows: 
 $$
a_{ij}^n=
\begin{cases}
1, \text{ if  $i=j+1$ or $j = i+1$}\\

"Unlike the famous question of comparing  $e^\pi$  and  $\pi^e$ , which I solved almost instantly, I am stuck with this problem.  My thought was the following. 
 Since exponential function is order-preserving, we exponentiate both terms and get  $\pi$  and  $e^{\pi-2}$ .  Then we study the function  $f(x) = e^{x-2} - x$  or the function  $g(x) = \frac{e^{x-2}}{x}$ , and compare them with zero and one respectively.  I tried both.  But both involve solving the equation
 $$e^{x-2} = x.$$ 
 I tried Lagrange error terms and have
 $$f(x) = -1 + \frac{(x-2)^2}{2!} + R_2(x-2),$$ 
where
 $$\frac{(x-2)^3}{3!} \le R_2(x-2) \le \frac{e^{x-2}}{3!} (x-2)^3.$$ 
 It is easy to see that the equation have a root between  $3$  and  $2 + \sqrt2$ .  But I don't know how close it is to  $\pi$ .  It is to provide some lower bounds since we can plug in some values and calculate to show that  $f(x) > 0$  for such values.  But for the upper bound, it is hard to calculate by hands since it has the  $e^{x-2}$  factor.  At my best attempt by hand, I showed that  $f(3.15) > 0$ .  All it entails is that for all  $x \ge 3.15$ ,  $e^{x-2}$  is greater than  $x$ .  But it tells nothing about the other side. 
 Then I looked at the calculator and find that  $e^{\pi-2} < \pi$ . 
 I also tried Newton-Raphson iteration, but it involves a lot of exponentiation which is hard to calculate by hand and also involves approximation by themselves.  And I don't know how fast and close the iteration converges to the true root of the equation.

"Background: the  integer square root  function is defined as  $\DeclareMathOperator{\isqrt}{isqrt}\isqrt{\left(x\right)}=\lfloor\sqrt{x}\rfloor$ . There are methods to compute the integer square root using only integers (see previous link), which makes it useful for approximating the real square root on computers with limited processing power. 
 I'm interested in calculating what could be called the ""integer hypotenuse"" function:  $\DeclareMathOperator{\ihypot}{ihypot}\ihypot{\left(x,y\right)}=\lfloor\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\rfloor$ .* This can be calculated using the same methods as the integer square root, but  are there ""better"" approaches that somehow exploit the form of the argument (the sum of two squares) while still only requiring integers for computation? 
 I realize that is somewhat vague, so here's an example: One of the ways to find the integer square root is using binary search. Binary search requires an upper and lower bound. Since 
 $$ 0 \le \lfloor\sqrt{a}\rfloor \le a$$ 
 $0$  and  $a$  are often (always?) used as the bounds. We could naively do the same thing with the integer hypotenuse: 
 $$ 0 \le \lfloor\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\rfloor \le a^2 + b^2$$ 
 but we can find tighter bounds by realizing that the argument is the sum of squares and using the triangle inequality: 
 $$ \max\left(\left|a\right|,\left|b\right|\right) \le \lfloor\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\rfloor \le \left|a\right| + \left|b\right|$$ 
 Using those bounds would mean fewer iterations would be required to find the solution using binary search, so that's an example of a ""better"" approach that exploits the form of the argument. 
 I can't rigorously define ""better"", but I'm using it in the sense of ""requiring less computational resources (including time and memory)"" to get the answer. Things that might be better include: 
 
 Approaches that require fewer iterations (like the example above). 
 Not having to explicitly calculate  $a^2 + b^2$ . (Calculating  $a^2 + b^2$  could lead to integer overflow issues on a computer.) 
 Not having to divide by anything other than a power of 2. (Arbitrary division is expensive on a computer.) 
 
 Here's an example of what the second bullet might look like --- except that it doesn't work: 
 Heron's method for calculating the square root makes use of the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means as follows: 
 $$\sqrt{a} = \sqrt{x \frac{a}{x}} \leq \frac{1}{2}\left(x + \frac{a}{x}\right)$$ 
 Then you can make an initial guess at the solution  $x_0$ , iterate  $x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(x_n + \frac{a}{x_n}\right)$ , and  $x_n$  will approach  $\sqrt{a}$ . 
 I was tempted to do the following: 
 $$\sqrt{a^2+b^2} = \sqrt{\left(a+bi\right)\left(a-bi\right)} \leq \frac{1}{2}\left(\left(a+bi\right)x + \frac{a-bi}{x}\right)$$ 
 and then iterate in the same way as above. This looks promising and avoids ever having to calculate  $a^2$  or  $b^2$ . However the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means only works for real numbers, so the above line is wrong. (There is a generalization to complex numbers --- eq 1.1  here , but it added enough complication that it didn't look promising to me.) 
 Also, just to be explicit: I'm not interested in approximations or methods that don't use integers for intermediary steps. 
 * I realize that this name might sound weird: The hypotenuse is the side of a triangle --- not a function! The motivation is that programming languages typically have separate built-in functions for calculating the square root and the length of the hypotenuse (e.g.  math.sqrt  and  math.hypot  in Python). Python even has an integer square root function:  math.isqrt . I'm interested in an integer version of the hypotenuse function --- hence the name.

 We have $k$ urns, each has number from range $1\dots k$. On the beggining, every urn has $b$ black balls and $w$ white balls. We start from numer $1$.
In each step, we draw ball from number $s$ and put it to the urn with higher number($s+1$). In last step we draw ball from $k$-th urn. What is probability that this ball is white?  
 I tried basic 'tree method' to see some regularity and i came up with simple random variable 
$B_k = \text{#of white balls in k-th urn}$ 
So our probability would be 
$$P(B_k=w | B_{k-1}=w) = \frac{b+1}{b+1+w}$$
$$P(B_k=w+1 | B_{k-1} = w) = \frac{w}{b+1+w}$$
$$P(B_k=w | B_{k-1} = w+1) = \frac{b}{b+1+w}$$
$$P(B_k=w+1 | B_{k-1} = w+1) = \frac{w+1}{b+1+w}$$

"When I was younger I wasn't paying too much attention or the teacher did not make sure we understood how the square root works. Recently I was faced with some problems where having the right knowledge would help a lot. I tried to rethink the stuff, but I got stuck, and the results on internet did not lead to the solutions of my problem 
 My problem seems to focus on the notations.  $\sqrt{c}$  in my mind means any number that squared results ""c"":  $x^2 = c$ 
 As example:  $x = \sqrt{4}$  shall have 2 solutions: -2 and 2, because both squared results 4. I understood that  $\sqrt{c}$  always means the positive root, so it always have 1 solution. So I take this as a ""fake"" sqrt, and the 2 is the only solution 
 In order to comprehend this behavior so I will have faster responses, I told to myself 2 rules: 
 
 when the square root is generated by myself (like applying square root to both sides of ecuation), use the  $\pm\sqrt{c}$  notation 
 when getting rid of it (such as squaring both sides), just get rid of the square root, calculate solutions, and check them as there could be additional invalid ones 
 
 So for  $x = \sqrt{4}$ , I can square both sides and get  $x^2 = 4$ , where x is  $\pm2$ , and then check in the initial ecuation and get rid of -2. The problem comes here: I was told that squaring such a ""fake"" sqrt could result only in true solutions (aka no check required after) by using || to the member inside. It indeed forces the positivity, but it doesn't work with the following example: 
 $\sqrt{x} = \sqrt{2}$ 
 The only solution there is 2, but using the || knowledge I was talking about: by squaring both sides I get |x| = |2|, then |x| = 2. It nows yeild 2 solutions:  $\pm2$ , so the promise that it doesn't require any check is vanished. If it requires checks, why is then even required the ||? My method before being reminded about || took care of the problem without any logic overhead

"Consider a set of words where you want to divide the set into subsets of words, where  all members of each subset are anagrams  (same letters, different arrangement). You can do this computationally in several ways, the ""best"" way is sorting the letters from A through Z in each word. If two words are equal when their respective letters are sorted, then they must be anagrams. Otherwise, they are not. For the general case we cannot do any better. The sorting, which is $\mathcal{O}(M \log M)$ for each word of length $M$, is the computationally hardest part.  
 But here is something I've been discussing.  Suppose we know there is a longest word  with $M$ characters. Then imagine we have a so-called ""hash function"" $f$ which maps a word to a positive integer. Let each letter A,B,C,...,Z have a specific weight $a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots,a_{26}$. For a word $x$, the value $f(x)$ is the sum of the corresponding weights without regard to their position within the word. $f(ZABC) = a_{26} + a_1 + a_2 + a_3$. This has linear complexity, $\mathcal{O}(M)$ for each word. 
 If we can select these weights such that only words that are anagrams map to the same value, then a computer can easily calculate whether two words are anagrams by looking at their respective function value. The question is of course,  how do we choose the weights ? 
 I can formulate the problem as such: 
 
 For fixed $M$ and $N$, find $\{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{N}\}$, where $a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_{N}$, such that $$c_ia_i \neq c_1a_1 + c_2a_2 + \dots + c_{i-1}a_{i-1} + c_{i+1}a_{i+1} + \dots + c_{N}a_{N}$$ for any combination of $c_j \in \{0,1,2,\dots,M\}$ except $c_1=c_2=\dots=c_{N}=0$. 
 
 Basically, we want to find a linearly independent $N$-subset of $\Bbb Z_{>0}$ subject to a constraint on the coefficients. Is there a clever method for this? 
 A very simple solution  is to let $a_1 = 1$ and recursively define $a_{i+1} = Ma_i + 1$ but this grows very quickly and $a_{26}$ is too large for use in computers. For small $M$ and $N$ I have been able to find better solutions.  
 Is there a better solution for $N=26$ and say $M \approx 15$? What is the smallest possible $a_{26}$?

 So we calculate the residue for these points. They did not show the calculation, but they said that  $\operatorname{Res}(f,0) = 0$  and  $\operatorname{Res}(f,\frac{1}{b}) = \frac{1+b^4}{b^4(b-a)}$ . 
 can someone please explain to me how to culculate such thing with  $\bar{z}$  ? 
 solution:
 $\int\limits_{|z|=1} \frac{z^4 +1}{(1-az)(bz-1)} \mathrm{d}z$ 
 $\lim\limits_{z\to 0}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}(z^2f(z))$  =  $\lim\limits_{z\to 0}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}(z^2\cdot\frac{z^4+1}{(1-az)(bz-1)})$ 
= $$\lim\limits_{z\to 0}\frac{-4abz^7+5az^6+5bz^6-6z^5+az^2+bz^2-2z}{\left(1-az\right)^2\left(bz-1\right)^2}$$ = $0$ 
 $\lim\limits_{z\to \frac{1}{b}}((z-\frac{1}{b})\cdot\frac{z^4+1}{(1-az)(bz-1)})$  =
 $\frac{b^4+1}{b^3(b-a)}$

"I am not very experienced in mathematical notation, so please excuse some terminology misuse or formatting shortcomings. 
 I have a project in which a value needs to increase from a set minimum to a set maximum in a set number of seconds. It is easy to calculate the linear value based on ratios. 
 Let $v$ = desired value, $n$ = minimum limit, $x$ = maximum limit, $t$ = elapsed time, and $t_x$ = allocated time: 
 $$v = \frac{t}{t_x}(x-n) + n.$$ 
 Thus if my values are: 
 $$n = 5, x = 90, t_x = 1800 \text{ (half hour)}$$ 
 For elapsed time of $5$ minutes ($600$ s): 
 $$v = \frac{600}{1800} (90-5) + 5 = 33.3.$$ 
 The problem is I want to change this linear growth to exponential growth, and I'm not sure how to alter the formula. 
 So instead of $33.3$ at $5$ minutes, I would rather have $13$ for example. (Slow initial change, rapid later change.)

"Consider repeated independent trials of two outcomes S (success) or F (failure) with probabilities  $p$  and  $q$ , respectively. Determine the distribution of the number of trials required for the first occurrence of the event 50 S containing at least one SSSSS, i.e., totally 50 successes and the 5 successive successes should happen at least one time. 
 My efforts: 
 Let  $M_n$  be the number of trials required for the first occurrence of totally  $n$  S. We have calculated that  $P(M_n=k)={k-1\choose n-1}p^{n}q^{k-n}$ . Let  $N_n$  be the number of trials required for the first occurrence of totally  $n$  S containing at least one SSSSS. Then  $P(N_n=k)=0$  if  $n<5$ . We want to determine the distribution of  $N_{50}$ . 
 Condition on the following possible initial events: 
 
 A1: The first five results were Fxxxx (with probability  $q$  ), x = S or F, 
 A2: The first five results were SFxxx (with probability  $pq$  ), 
 A3: The first five results were SSFxx (with probability  $p^2q$ ), 
 A4: The first five results were SSSFx (with probability  $p^3q$ ), 
 A5: The first five results were SSSSF (with probability  $p^4q$ ), 
 A6: The first five results were SSSSS (with probability  $p^5$ ). 
 
 Note that  $P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3)+P(A_4) +P(A_5)+P(A_6)=1$ . 
 Let  $k>5$ . 
 In case 1,  $P(N_n=k∣\text{first result was F})=P(N_n=k−1)$  because we have just not made any progress towards  $n$  S containing SSSSS with the first result, and there are now  $k−1$  trials remaining to get  $n$  S containing SSSSS. 
 In case 2,  $P(N_n=k∣\text{first two results were SF})=P(N_{n-1}=k−2)$ . Although we have just not made any progress towards SSSSS with the first two results, but we do have a S and there is  $(n-1)$  S remaining. There are now  $k−2$  trials remaining to get  $(n-1)$  S containing SSSSS. 
 In case 3,  $P(N_n=k∣\text{first three results were SSF})=P(N_{n-2} =k−3)$ . Although we have just not made any progress towards SSSSS with the first three results, but we do have two S and there is  $(n-2)$  S remaining. There are now  $k−3$  trials remaining to get  $(n-2)$  S containing SSSSS. 
 In case 4,  $P(N_n=k∣\text{first four results were SSSF})=P(N_{n-3} =k−4)$ . Although we have just not made any progress towards SSSSS with the first four results, but we do have three S and there is  $(n-3)$  S remaining. There are now  $k−4$  trials remaining to get  $(n-3)$  S containing SSSSS.

Although we have just not made any progress towards SSSSS with the first five results, but we do have four S and there is  $(n-4)$  S remaining. There are now  $k−5$  trials remaining to get  $(n-4)$  S containing SSSSS. 
 In case 6,  $P(N_n=k\mid\text{first five results were SSSSS})=P(M_{n-5}=k−5)$ . We already have SSSSS. We no longer need to worry about SSSSS. We just need to get  $(n-5)$  S and we are done. There are now  $k−5$  trials remaining to get  $(n-5)$  S. 
 If you put that all together using the Law of Total Probability
 $$P(N_n =k)=P(N_n =k\mid A_1)P(A_1)+P(N_n =k\mid A_2)P(A_2)+
+\cdots+P(N_n =k\mid A_6)P(A_6),$$ 
where  $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_6$  are the 6 possible initial events, then you get the recursive formula for  $k> 5$ , 
 $$P(N_n =k)=qP(N_n =k−1)+pqP(N_{n-1} =k−2)+p^2qP(N_{n-2} =k−3) 
+\cdots+ p^4qP(N_{n-4} =k−5)+p^5P(M_{n-5}=k−5)$$ 
 Am I on the correct track? Some strange things happen when I tried to calculate the base case  $P(N_5=k)$ . Please tell me what is  $P(N_5=k)$  and help me verify the recursive relation for  $P(N_6=k)$ .

"Let $n_{1},\ n_{2},\ n_{3},\ \cdots,\ n_{r}$ be positive integers such that
$\gcd(n_{i}, n_{j})=1$ for $1 \le \quad i\neq j \quad \le r$ 
 Then the simultaneous linear congruences $ x\equiv a_i \pmod {n_i} $ for all $1 \le i \le r$ has a solution satisfying all these equations. Moreover the solution is unique modulo
$n_1 n_2 n_3 \cdots n_r$. 
 Proof of Existence.  I skip proof of uniqueness. Let $n=n_{1}n_{2}n_{3}\cdots n_{r}$. For each integer $k=1,2,3,\ \cdots,\ r$, let $N_{k} =n_{1}n_{2}n_{3}\cdots n_{k-1}n_{k+1}\cdots n_{r}$ = the product of all the moduli $n_{i}$ with the modulus $n_{k}$ missing.  
 
 (1)  How can you prefigure to consider this, to start the proof? This product is uncanny? 
 
 We are given that $\gcd(n_i, n_j)=1$ for $i\neq j$.  By reason of $\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(a,c) =1,$ then $\gcd(a, bc) = 1$.  Thence $\gcd(N_k, n_k ) = 1$. 
 Consider if the linear congruence $N_k x\equiv 1 \pmod{n_k}$ has any solutions. 
 
 (2)  Where does $N_{k}x\equiv 1 \pmod{n_k}$ hail from? How can you prefigure to consider this? 
 
 Since $\gcd(N_k, n_k) = 1$, thence by reason of the  Linear Congruence Theorem , the linear congruence $N_{k}x\equiv 1 \pmod {n_k}$ has a unique solution. Dub it $x_k$, thence $$ \color{magenta}{ N_k x_k \equiv 1\pmod{n_k}. \tag{♯} }$$ 
 We construct a solution which satisfies all the given simultaneous linear congruences: 
 $$
x^* =a_1 N_1 x_1 + a_2 N_2 x_2 + a_3 N_3 x_3 +\cdots + a_r N_r x_r
$$ 
 
 (3)  Where does this construction hail from? Can you calculate this?  
 
 Let us see if this satisfies the first given linear congruence $ x\equiv a_1 \pmod {n_1} $. 
 By the above definition of $N_{2},\ N_{3},\ N_{4}, \ldots, N_{r}$ these numbers are multiplies of $n_{1}$. 
 Therefore $ a_{2}N_{2}x_{2}\equiv 0\pmod {n_1}, a_{3}N_{3}x_{3}\equiv 0 \pmod {n_1} \cdot,\ a_{r}N_{r}x_{r}\equiv 0 \pmod {n_1} $, 
 Thence if I take $x^*$ to modulus $n_1$, then by cause of $\color{magenta}{(♯)}$
$$\begin{align} x^*  & \equiv a_{1}N_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}N_{2}x_{2}+a_{3}N_{3}x_{3}+\cdots+a_{r}N_{r}x_{r} \pmod {n_1} \\
& \equiv  a_{1} \color{magenta}{ N_{1}x_{1} }+0+0+\cdots+0 \\
& \equiv a_{1} \color{magenta}{ 1 } \pmod {n_1}
\end{align}$$ 
 Hence $x^*$ satisfies the first simultaneous congruence $x\equiv a_1 \pmod {n_1}$. Similarly we can show that the solution constructed satisfies the remaining congruences.

"The law states that
 $$T'(t) = k(T_s - T(t))$$ 
with  $T_s$  the surrounding temperatures. I now have the following information:
A chicken comes out of the refrigerator and has a temperature of -20 degrees (celcicus). She's placed in the oven of 200 degrees (so this would be  $T_s$  I suppose) for 20 minutes after which it has a temperature of 20 degrees. calculate k out of this. 
 So I tried to solve this equation using an integrating factor to make the equation exact. 
 $$T'(t) = k(200-T(t))$$ 
 $$T'=200k -kT$$ 
 $$T' + kT = 200k$$ 
using  $u =e^{-kt} $ 
 $$T'e^{-kt} + kTe^{-kt} = 200ke^{-kt}$$ 
 $$\int T'e^{-kt} (dT) = \int 200k(dt)$$ 
 $$Te^{-kt} = -200e^{-kt}+C$$ 
 $$T=-200+\frac{C}{e^{-kt}}$$ 
Now filling in the numbers
 $$20=-200+\frac{C}{e^{-20k}}$$ 
 And this is where I'm stuck and probably wrong too. The oficial answer is that  $k=0.01003$ . But I'm still stuck with a constant  $C$  so probably I'm doing something completely wrong

 So, I have a set of points, $(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ where it is NOT necessarily the case that $x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n$ as is the usual condition for a spline, but I'd like to use a spline-like approximation. 
 I'm sure this must be a problem that has been thoroughly addressed in the literature, but I can't figure out what to search for.  If someone could at least tell me some keywords to search for, I would appreciate it. 
 Edit: After doing some more thinking and hunting around, I believe the key is going to be to use separate splines to represent the $x$ and $y$ coordinates in terms of some other parameter, $t$, i.e., as a set of parametric equations.  So, for example, if I had four points, I could represent $x$ and $y$ as cubic polynomials: 
 $x = at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d$ and $y = et^3 + ft^2 + gt + h$.  Since $t$ is an arbitrary parameter, I could let it take on integer values, e.g., $t = 0,1,2,3$ in order to make solving the system easier. 
 The problem is that $t$ isn't really a natural parameter.  I would prefer something like arc length so that I could calculate and presumably minimize the bending energy.  Somehow, I will have to incorporate that into my calculation at a later stage.

I was really asking this to figure out how tough of a question this is.  At least for anon, not very tough, it would seem. 
 In case any of you are curious, one way to calculate these coefficients is like so: 
 If $C_k$ are the Gregory Coefficients, the first few terms being $-1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{12}, \frac{1}{24}, \frac{19}{720}, \frac{3}{160},...$, and we have the strict divisor function such that 
 $d_0'(j) = 1$ if $n = 1$, $0$ otherwise 
 $d_1'(j) = 1$ if $n \neq 1$, $0$ otherwise 
 $d_k'(n) = \sum\limits_{j | n} d_1'(j) d_{k-1}'(n/j )$ 
 then $c_k = \sum\limits_{a=0} -1^a C_a d_a'(k)$ 
 There's a straightforward reason why the Gregory coefficients show up, involving Linnik's identity $\sum\limits_{k=1} \frac{-1^{k+1}}{k} d_k'(n) = \frac{\Lambda(n)}{\log n}$and multiplicative inverses of series coefficients, but I won't go into that.

 This is basically of the form $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i(0.5)^i.$ 
 I flipped open my calculus book to review how to solve this series but I didn't find anything on how to calculate the limiting value for a power series, just the radius of convergence.   
 I see for a sum of infinite geometric series, the value is: 
 $S_n = a+ ax + ax^2 + ... + ax^n + ... = \cfrac{a}{1-x}$ for |x| < 1. 
 Can someone please tell me the general approach if there is one for a power series?   
 Thank you in advance.

"I am making a game where players can win or lose based on dice they throw. 
 
 Player throws $M$ number of dice. 
 By default a success is considered when a die rolls $5$ or $6$. 
 Player needs to get $N$ successful dice to win. 
 
 The basic formula to calculate the probability of the player winning looks like this (Cumulative Binomial Distribution): 
 $$1 - \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \binom{M}{k}  p^k (1-p)^{M-k} $$ 
 Then $p = 2 / 6$ (probability of success where $5$ & $6$ are considered as success) 
 The player can also have different effects during the game that increase their chances: 
 
 Blessed - Dice sides that count as success: $4 ,5 ,6$ 
 Cursed - Dice sides that count as success: $6$ 
 
 In these cases I just change the $p$ to $3 / 6$ in case of Blessed and to $1 / 6$ in cased of Cursed. 
 Now I have the problem calculating the probability in the following case: 
 
 ""Each $6$ your roll counts as $2$ successes"" - I guess this is self explanatory. So now each dice that rolls a $6$ will be considered as $2$ successes. 
 
 How can I adapt my formula to take this effect into consideration? 
 Let me know if something is not clear. 
 
 Edit: By default when you throw a die you can get the following results: 
 $$\matrix{1 &\text{fail}\\
2 &\text{fail}\\
3 &\text{fail}\\
4 &\text{fail}\\
5 &\text{success}\\
6 &\text{success}}$$ 
 When player is Blessed it changes to:
$$\matrix{1 &\text{fail}\\
2 &\text{fail}\\
3 &\text{fail}\\
4 &\text{success}\\
5 &\text{success}\\
6 &\text{success}}$$ 
 When player is Cursed, you get:
$$\matrix{1 &\text{fail}\\
2 &\text{fail}\\
3 &\text{fail}\\
4 &\text{fail}\\
5 &\text{fail}\\
6 &\text{success}}$$ 
 
 Edit2: Let's forget about dice for a second. Seems like I won't be able to reuse the old formula. 
 Let's say that each turn for $M$ turns, I get a value with the following probability: 
 $$\matrix{Value &Normal&Blessed&Cursed\\
0 &4/6 & 3/6 & 5/6\\
1 &1/6 & 2/6 & 0/6\\
2 &1/6 & 1/6 & 1/6\\
}$$ 
 How do I calculate the probability that the sum of the values is at least $N$ or bigger?

 $$\int_{\Bbb R} \int_{\Bbb R} f(x, y) d\lambda(y) d\lambda(x).$$ 
 
 Edit: 
 I deleted my former approach and would like to try a new one: 
 We are allowed to assume that 
 $$f = f_+ + f_-.$$ 
 Hence, we are allowed to write the inner integral as  
 $$\int_{\Bbb R} f(x, y)_+ d\lambda(x) + \int_{\Bbb R} f(x, y)_- d\lambda(x) = \int_{\Bbb R} {1 \over x^2 + y^2} d\lambda(x) + \int_{\Bbb R}  {-1 \over x^2 + y^2} d\lambda(x).$$ 
 Using the linearity of the integral, we receive: 
 $$\int_{\Bbb R} {1 \over x^2 + y^2} d\lambda(x) - \int_{\Bbb R} {1 \over x^2 + y^2} d\lambda(x).$$ 
 Both integrals are identical, hence their difference is $0$, and so is the outer integral then.  
 Is that a valid answer?

"I am absolutely confused about trying to calculate circumference. And I do not mean using the math formula, I mean back in old days when people had very primitive tools, and had to make the discoveries. 
 In order to create a circle you can take a long strip of paper and try to fold it into a circle. By knowing paper's length you can know circumference. However how would you go about putting the piece of paper into perfect circle to measure the diameter? No matter what you do you might be just a millimeter off while trying to measure the diameter. 
 Now let's say you take a compass and draw a circle. You will be able to easily measure the diameter, however you will not be able to fold a strip of paper into a perfect circle, again it might be just a millimeter off. 
 Third way I can think of they used is to first draw a square inside and outside of the circle you draw with compass. Then you changes it into pentagon, then hexagon and so forth and use math to try to find the circumference. But again I think it does not allow you to calculate with perfect precision (no calculators, primitive age). 
 Due to that no matter what you do you will not be able to perfectly derive formulas to calculate circumference if given diameter or vice versa. So how exactly did the people derive these formulas and make perfect circles with all the values know and discover pi? 
 Sorry I tried searching but didn't find anything. I would really love to know the answer.

"Problem:  I would like to know the number of elements in the cartesian power $X^n$ (cartesian product of one set $X$ by itself, $n$ times) with a majority constraint: how many elements in $X^n$ have a (relative) majority of one element of the set (say $x\in X$)? 
 On top of that, I'd like to fix one element in the cartesian power to a certain value (say the second), and count the number of possibilities with this fixed value. 
 Simple example : with $X=\{A, B, C\}$ and $n=4$. The question is: how many four-letter words with an $A$ in the second position have a (relative) majority of $A$'s? And how many have a (relative) majority of $B$'s? 
 Solution for the simple example : We can iterate on the total number $k$ of the element we want as a (relative) majority (say $A$). 
 
 With $k=4$ elements being $A$, there is 1 option ($A$ is the majority, and $A$ is in the second position) 
 
 
 $AAAA$ 
 
 
 With $k=3$ elements being $A$, there are three possibilities for locating $A$'s. The second element is $A$ by constraint. The two extra $A$'s can be in position $(1,3), (1,4)$ or $(3,4)$. And there is one free position, where it can be everything but $A$: 2 possibilities. In total: $3\times 2=6$ possibilities. 
 
 
 $AAAB, AAAC, AABA, AACA, BAAA, CAAA$ 
 
 
 With $k=2$ elements being $A$'s, there is an extra-challenge: the two remaining positions should not be the same, otherwise $A$'s are not a majority anymore. About locating the $A$'s, one is fixed in the second position and the other $A$ can be in position $(1)$, $(3)$ or $(4)$: 3 possibilities. In the two remaining positions, there are 2 possibilities for the first one ($B$ or $C$ but not $A$) and 1 possibility for the second one (not $A$ and not the same than the first one). Total: 6 possibilities. 
 
 
 $AABC, AACB, BAAC, CAAB, BACA, CABA$ 
 
 
 With $k=1$ element being $A$, there are zero possibilities for $A$ to be a majority (three remaining possibilities, with only two letters, $B$ and $C$, so necessarily a majority of $B$ or $C$). 
 
 
 
 
 So with $n=4$ and 3 elements in the original set, there are 13 possibilities. 
 General solution?  Is there a closed form formula to compute this number?

"If I know exactly what cards are left in the deck, what the dealer's current hand is, and what my current hand is, how would I go about calculating the probability that hitting is a good idea. So, it would be beneficial to hit if the probability that you will win after drawing a random card is greater than the probability that you will win with your current hand. Furthermore, the probability that you will win is the probability that your hand is higher than what the dealer's hand will be when he finishes drawing (I'm assuming they stop on 17 or higher) OR the dealer busts. I'm struggling mainly to pin down the exact probability that your hand will be higher than the dealers.

Also, I know this question is a bit long, so if there are any clarifications I can provide, please let me know.

 On  $X = C^0\big([a,b]\big)$ , for any  $p \in \mathbb{R}$ ,  $p>1$ , we define the  $L^p$  norm by,
    $$\|f\|_{L^{p}}:=\big(\int^{b}_{a}|f(x)|^{p}dx \big)^{1/p}.$$   
 Show that for  $p\neq 2$ , this norm is not induced by a scalar product. 
 
 My method of trying to prove this was to prove a contradiction to the parallelogram rule, 
 $$  \|f+g\|^{2}_{p} + \|f-g\|^{2}_{p} = 2\|f\|^{2}_{p} + 2\|g\|^{2}_{p}, \tag{$1$}$$ 
 where  $f,g \in C^{0}([a,b])$ . 
 So I defined the following functions; 
 $$f(x):=\frac{a+b}{2}-x$$ 
 $$g(x) := \begin{cases}\frac{a+b}{2}-x, \ \ for \ \ a \leq x \le \frac{a+b}{2}. \\
x-\frac{a+b}{2}, \ \ for \ \ \frac{a+b}{2} < x \le b \end{cases}$$ 
 which gives  
 $$f(x)+g(x) = \begin{cases} a+b-2x, \ \ & for \ \ a\le x \le \frac{a+b}{2}. \\ 0, & for \ \ \frac{a+b}{2} < x \le b\end{cases}$$ 
 $$f(x)-g(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & for \ \ a \le x \le \frac{a+b}{2}. \\
2x - (a+b), \ \ & for \ \ \frac{a+b}{2} < x \le b \end{cases}$$ 
 Then I proceeded to calculate each term of the parallelogram rule,  
 $$\|f+g\|^{2}_{p} = \bigg( \int^{\frac{a+b}{2}}_{a}|a+b-2x|^{p}\bigg)^{2/p} = \frac{(b-a)^{\frac{2(p+1)}{p}}}{(2(p+1))^{2/p}} $$ 
 $$ \|f-g\|^{2}_{p} = \bigg( \int_{\frac{a+b}{2}}^{b}|2x- (a+b)|^{p}\bigg)^{2/p} = \frac{(b-a)^{\frac{2(p+1)}{p}}}{(2(p+1))^{2/p}}$$ 
 $$2\|f\|^{2}_{p} = 2 \bigg( \int^{b}_{a}| \frac{a+b}{2}-x|^{p} dx \bigg)^{2/p} = 2 \cdot \frac{2^{2/p}(\frac{b-a}{2})^{\frac{2(p+1)}{p}}}{(p+1)^{2/p}} $$ 
 $$\begin{align}2 \|g\|^{2}_{p}  & = 2 \bigg(\int^{\frac{a+b}{2}}_{a} |\frac{a+b}{2} - x|^{p} dx \ + \ \int^{b}_{\frac{a+b}{2}}|x- \frac{a+b}{2}|^{p} dx\bigg)^{2/p} \\  & =2 \cdot \frac{2^{2/p}(\frac{b-a}{2})^{\frac{2(p+1)}{p}}}{(p+1)^{2/p}} \end{align}$$ 
 Plugging into  $(1)$  we then get 
 $$2 \cdot \frac{(b-a)^{\frac{2(p+1)}{p}}}{(2(p+1))^{2/p}} = 4 \cdot \frac{2^{2/p}(\frac{b-a}{2})^{\frac{2(p+1)}{p}}}{(p+1)^{2/p}}$$ 
which simplifies quite nicely to  
 $$2^{p} = 4.$$   
 So the equality only holds for  $p = 2$ . 
 Is what i've done correct? is there another way of proving the question which is better?

Suppose there are  $m$  absorbing barriers  $B=\{(x_1,y_1),\cdots,(x_m,y_m)\}$  inside the grid. Once the person is on a barrier, the random walk process stops.

"Note that I edited this post significantly to make it more clear (as clear as I think I could possibly make it). First, let me mention what I am NOT asking: 
 
 I am NOT asking  for  the largest number we could calculate. 
 I am NOT asking if there is a largest number (if there were, just add one and it would be bigger, so obviously this is false) 
 I am NOT asking for something like ""divide by zero"" or for limits (""infinity"" isn't an answer, that isn't a number) 
 
 
 I have been thinking a lot about numbers and I put a couple numbers into Wolfram Alpha just to see what happens. It can handle  insanely huge numbers , but it fails as soon as you put in $10! ^ {10!}$. After thinking for a few days, I feel that there  must  be a  largest number  that we could possibly ever  calculate  or  define . In fact, I think there are an infinite number of numbers greater than anything we could ever calculate (I am saying larger numbers exist, but we cannot do anything with them, except maybe prove there are numbers so large we can't calculate them).  
 I mean a  number  or an equation that results in an exact number (such as $x!^{x!^{x!^{x!^{x!^{...}}}}}$, where $x$ is an exact number that can be written out) I think there is a limit here. There is a largest number possible because there are only so many atoms in the observable universe. But how would one prove this (that there are numbers so large we couldn't define them)? Is there any information on this?  
 Interestingly, of the irrational numbers we use, they  always  have an alternative way to write them such that the answer is exact. One can simply write the infinitely long irrational number that is the square root of two as $\sqrt 2$. Two symbols and you define the infinitely long number that is the square root of $2$. One can use the formulas for finding $\pi$. But aren't there numbers that we couldn't even do that for? Aren't there numbers that we couldn't write in some form, such as how we write $\sqrt 2$? Such that the number is exact? I think these numbers must exist, but we can't do anything with them. But I have no idea how one could  prove  that or if there is any information regarding these numbers. So my question is: are there numbers that are just too large (or too precise) that we can't write them down in any way at all that expresses their exact value? 
 
 UPDATE: 
 I accidentally came across something that really helps with my question. I found this  article here , and I saw  point #6:  
 
 Unknowable Thing: There are numbers that can’t be computed. 
 This is another mind bender proved by Alan Turing.

"Suppose that virus transmision in 500 acts of intercourse are mutually independent events and that the probability of transmission in any one act is $\frac{1}{500}$. What is the probability of infection? 
 So I do know that one way to solve this is to find the probability of complement of the event we are trying to solve. Letting $C_1,C_2,C_3...C_{500}$ denote the events that a virus does not occur during encounters 1,2,....500. The probability of no infection is: 
 $$P(C_1\cap C_2 \cap....\cap C_{500}) = (1 - (\frac{1}{500}))^{500} = 0.37$$ 
 then to find the probability of infection I would just do : $1 - 0.37 = 0.63$ 
 but my question is how would I find the probability not using the complement? I would have thought since the events are independent and each with probability of $\frac{1}{500}$ that if I multiplied each independet event I could obtain the value, but that is not the case. What am I forgetting to consider if I wanted to calculate this way?  I'm asking more so to have a fuller understanding of both sides of the coin. 
 Edit: I think I may have figured out what I'm missing in my thinking. In the case of trying to figure out the probability of infection I have to take into account that infection could occur on the first transmission, or the second, or the third,...etc. Also transmission could occur on every interaction or on a few interactions but not all. So in each of these scenarios I would encounter some sort of combination of probabilities like $(\frac{499}{500})(\frac{499}{500})(\frac{1}{500})(\frac{499}{500})......(\frac{1}{500})$ as an example of one possible combination.

The following formula can roughly describe it: $R = e^{-t/s}$ where $R$ is memory retention, $S$ is the relative strength of memory, and $t$ is time.""""""   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve 
 I'd just like to understand what this math is trying to say.  Such that if I want $100\%$ retention level of something, thus as my relative strength is less the more time it will take to remember something.  But also that as my retention increases, the less amount of time it takes to have strength of memory reviewed.   
 So I suppose I can articulate it, but how can I use the equation to roughly calculate how I'm doing remembering something?   
 Wolfram Alpha puts $t = -s \log(R)$ and gives a funky 3D graph.  But if I use $R=1$ then $t=0$.  If $R=100$, $t=-900$.  So a bit confusing.  I think the wikipedia graphic is more germane to understanding that as the y axis is R and that the graph exponentially decays, but at a different rate for each new iteration.  Kicking the can down the road so to speak... 
 So let's go for a low, medium and high retention graph based on hours in a day.  How can this be used in the formula to determine the time needed to study something again? 
 Let's say I have a class at 8am and I want to review it.  I'll have to review it early on, then increasingly less.  I'm just trying to ballpark when the best time to study is based on this decay graph.

 I'm a visually oriented person in general; for example, I prefer chess over cards because when I play chess, I do all my thinking by looking at the board and analyzing it, but when I play cards, I have to remember things and calculate things because the details are not visible or visual. That's why I did very well with traditional plane geometry problems at school. 
 I was good at problems that can be visually explained or visually modeled, like proving the equality of two line segments or two angles just by looking at the figure. It has always been more interesting for me than Algebra where I had to write down terms and rearrange them to reach the solution.

"Assume I have the ODE $\dot{p}(t) = f(t,p)$, with $p(0) = p_0$ and assume $f(t,p)$ (for simplicity) is only a function of $p$. I want to solve the ODE numerically, using derivative steps, kind of like Euler method. We know that
$$
\dot{p}(t) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{p(t+h)-p(t)}{h}
$$
and when taking a small, but finite $h$, we get that
$$
\dot{p} \approx \frac{p(t+h) - p(t)}{h}
$$
and from this, I can approximate the next step and get
$$
p(t+h) \approx p(t) + h\cdot f(p(t))

 Now I want to get a better approximation, and use the fact that
$$
\dot{p}(t) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{p(t+h) - p(t-h)}{2h}

 $H^0(X) = \mathbb R $ since $X$ is connected and $H^k(X) = 0$ for $k > 2$ since $\dim X = 2$. 
 To determine $H^1(X)$ and $H^2(X)$ take $ U_0 = \mathbb R^2 \setminus (\mathbb R \times \mathbb Z) $ and $U_1 = \mathbb R^2 \setminus (\mathbb Z \times \mathbb R)$.
 ,  
 Then $U_0 \stackrel{\text{homotopic}}{\simeq} \mathbb Z \simeq U_1, U_0 \cap U_1 \simeq \mathbb Z^2$ and therefore from the Mayer-Vietoris sequence we have
$$ H^1(U_0 \cap U_1) = 0 \rightarrow H^2(X) \rightarrow  H^2(U_0) \oplus H^2(U_1) = 0, $$

"A simple method to find the potential of a  conservative  vector field defined on a domain $D$ is to calculate the integral 
$$U(x,y,z)=\int_{\gamma} F \cdot ds$$ 
 On a curve $\gamma$ that is made of  segments parallel to the coordinate axes , that start from a chosen point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$. 
 I would like to know what are precisely the restrictions on $D$ for this method.  $D$ should be made in such way that ""any point can be connected to $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ with, indeed, a segment parallel to the coordinate axes"". 
 But what are  the sufficient mathematical conditions for $D$ in order to have this property? 
 I would say that it surely has to be connected, but that seems not to be enough. For example taking
$$D= \{ (x,y) : y>x-1\} \,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,(x_0,y_0)=(0,0)$$
$D$ is connected but I do not think that any point can be connected to $(0,0)$  via a segment parallel to the coordinate axes.

 But I didn't get any further. How to get the  $x-x_0$  out? I tried multiplying out the numerator and then using polynomial division but I didn't get a solution. 
 So I tried calculating the derivative directly, but that doesn't show it generally. 
 $f(x) = |1-x^2|^3 = (\sqrt{(1-x^2)^2})^3$ 
 $f'(x) \\= 3 \cdot (\sqrt{(1-x^2)^2})^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot ((1-x^2)^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 4x\cdot (1-x^2) \\ = 3 \cdot |1-x^2|^2 \cdot \frac{1}{|1-x^2|} \cdot 2x \cdot (1-x^2) \\= |1-x^2| \cdot 6x \cdot (1-x^2)$ 
 I looked at the graph. The graph looks like a ""W"" but with ""soft turns"". If I can prove that the function is differentiable in every point then it is a continuous function. 
 So how do I prove it using this definition:  $f'(x_0)=lim_{x\rightarrow x_0} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0}{x-x_0}$  ?

"Question:  Calculate the following determinant

"I have a elevator probability problem but with a twist (instead of people exiting the elevator, it is the elevator stopping on each level). Require some help understanding and completing the probability questions. 
 Problem: 
 4 people go into the elevator of a 5-storey shophouse. Assume that each of them exits the building uniformly at random at any of the 5 levels and independently of each other. N is the random variable which is the total number of elevator stops. 
 
 Describe the sample space for this random process. 
 
 Answer:  {1,2,3,4,5} 
 Understanding:  Sample space represents all the possible outcomes of the random event. Hence, the elevator can only stop at these 5 floors. Just like throwing a die and randomly getting a number, the sample space for that is {1,2,3,4,5,6}. 
 
 Let  $X_i$  be the random variable that equals to 1 if the elevator stops at floor i and 0, otherwise. Find the probability that the elevator stops at both floors  $a$  and  $b$  for  $a$ ,  $b$   $\in$  {1,2,3,4,5}. Find  $EX_aX_b$ .  
 
 Question:  Do they mean the elevator stop at two consecutive floors or two different floors? Can a and b be the same, a smaller than b and vice versa? 
 
 Prove the independence of  $EX_1X_2$ . 
 Calculate  $EN^2$  (represented as ( $X_1 + ...+ X_5)^2 = \sum_{(i,j)}  X_aX_b$  where the sum is over all ordered pairs (a,b) of numbers from {1,2,3,4,5} and the linearity of expectation. Find the variance of N. 
 Determine the distribution of N. That is, determine the probabilities of events N = i. Compute  $EN and EN^2$  directly by using the laws of expectation. 
 
 I got stuck from question 2 onwards with thinking of the possible ways that this can be done. It would be superb if someone can shed some light on them. Many thanks.

"Determine if the following integral exists and is finite: 
 $$\int^{+\infty}_{0}\dfrac{\log(x)}{1 + x\log^{2}(x)}dx$$ 
 So, usually to determine if an improper integral exists and is finite you would have to determine if the limit exists and is finite: 
 $$\lim_{b\to +\infty}\int^{b}_{a}\dfrac{\log(x)}{1 + x\log^{2}(x)}dx$$ 
 But that would require me to calculate the primitive of the function, and it doesn't look appealing.
When reading the calculus book made by my professor, I found a theorem that stated that for improper integrals of the type $[a, b[$ if $f(x)\ge 0$ in that interval, then the integral existed. 
 Now: $\dfrac{\log(x)}{1 + x\log^{2}(x)} \ge 0 $ only when $x \ge 1$, which is only a subset of the interval. Also in zero we have a divergence for log(x). 
 So my question is: does the theorem I mentioned above apply in this case, and if it does, why does it apply (considering the problems I've mentioned). 
 If it doesn't apply, what's the best course of action to find the primitive of the function?

"I am working on the following problem that involves annuity which deposits form a geometric progression. 
 
 Stan elects to receive his retirement benefit over  $20$  years at the rate of  $2,000$  per month beginning one month from now.  The monthly benefit increases by  $5\%$  each year.  At a nominal interest rate of  $6\%$  convertible monthly, calculate the present value of the retirement benefit. 
 
 I understand that when the deposits are forming a geometric progression, the present value at the time of the first deposit will be an annuity-due with the appropriate interest. 
 So, since the deposits increase with an annual rate of  $5\%$ , each month the deposits increase by  $r\%$  which can be calculated from 
 $$(1+r)^{12}=1.05$$ 
 Hence, 
 $$1+r=\sqrt[12]{1.05}-1$$ 
 Also, since the account adds a nominal interest rate of  $6\%$  convertible monthly, the deposit will accumulate  $i\%$  each month which can be calculated from 
 $$\left(1+\frac{6\%}{12}\right)=1+i$$ 
 Hence, 
 $$1+i = 1.005$$ 
 The present value at the moment of the first deposit is 
 $$2,000\left(1+\frac{1+r}{1+i}+\left(\frac{1+r}{1+i}\right)^2+ \dots + \left(\frac{1+r}{1+i}\right)^{239}\right)$$ 
 (Note: there are 240 conversions in 20 years) 
 so, 
 $$2,000 \frac{1-\left(\frac{1+r}{1+i}\right)^{-240}}{1-\frac{1+r}{1+i}}$$ 
 Using the present value factor  $(1+j)^{-1}=\frac{1+r}{1+i}$  we can see that the above expression is equivalent to 
 $$2,000 \ddot{a}_{\overline{240}\rceil j}$$ 
 So, according to my calculation the present value at the time of the first deposit  $X$  is equal to 
 $$X=2,000 \ddot{a}_{\overline{240}\rceil j} \approx 430,816.22$$ 
 Since this value is one conversion after the the very first month, I want to say that the answer to this problem must be 
 $$(1.005)^{-1}X \approx 428,627.86$$ 
 However, the answer in the book is supposedly  $419,253$ . 
 I thought that I counted the number of conversions wrong, and I tried it a couple of times but it still did not give me the right answer.  Can I have some help? 
 Thank you.

    To do this, I did a Fourier Transform of the initial equation, which I then solved for the Fourier Transform of $\Phi(\vec{r})$, $\hat{\Phi}(\vec{k})$ to obtain:
    $$\hat{\Phi}(\vec{k}) = \frac{4\pi\rho_0}{m\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{m^2 + k^2}$$
    When applying the Inverse Fourier Transform, the integral in question arises as the last integral to calculate - $\Phi(\vec{r})$ is given by
    $$\Phi(\vec{r}) = \frac{\rho_0}{\pi\epsilon_0 mr}\int_{0}^{\infty}dk\frac{\sin(kr)}{k(k^2 + m^2)}$$
    I have entered this integral into Wolfram Alpha, which gives me the result
    $$\Phi(\vec{r}) = \frac{\rho_0}{\epsilon_0 m^3 r}(1 - e^{-mr})$$
    This agrees with the result one obtains when calculating $\Phi(\vec{r})$ directly using the formula obtained by using the Green Function of the $\nabla^2$-Operator, so I know that it is correct. 
 However, I'd still be interested in how one would go about evaluating this integral, because none of the integration techniques that I know seem to work at all.

 I'm not sure if it's correct to say that the vector form form for the line of $z$ axis is $z: (0,0,0)+s(0,0,1)$? Then the parametric form would be $(0,0,s)$. Then:

"I'm doing some machine learning problems (namely logistic regression), and something I'm trying to do is calculate the decision boundary given a weight vector $\mathbf{w}$. 
 The decision boundary lies on $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} = 0$, and $\mathbf{w}^T$ is a $1 \times d$ vector, $\mathbf{x}$ is a $d \times 1$ vector. 
 What would be the simplest way to find an $\mathbf{x}$, given $\mathbf{w}$, such that the dot product is equal to $0$?  
 An example is $\mathbf{w} = [-1, 1, 0]$, and by brute force, I can find the vector $\mathbf{[1, 1, 0]}$, so $\mathbf{x}_1 = 0$ is the decision boundary (note that in the $\mathbf{x}$ vector, the first term is ALWAYS 1, so this can be omitted from the equation). Then essentially, the graph is 2D, and the decision boundary is at $\mathbf{x}_1 = 1$.

 $\bullet\;$ As my most recent example, I discovered (through questions here on MSE) that $\;\inf{\cdots}\;$ can simply be defined by postulating $$
z \leq \inf{A} \;\equiv\; \langle \forall a : a \in A : z \leq a \rangle
$$ for any $\;z\;$ and lower-bounded $\;A\;$.  Contrast this with \begin{align}
& z \in A \;\then\; \inf{A} \leq z \\
& \langle \forall a : a \in A : z \leq a \rangle \;\then\; z \leq \inf{A} \\
\end{align} or even \begin{align}
& z \in A \;\then\; \inf{A} \leq z \\
& \langle \forall \epsilon : \epsilon > 0 : \langle \exists a : a \in A : a < \inf{A} + \epsilon \rangle \rangle \\
\end{align} 
 $\bullet\;$ For sets, the symmetric difference is often defined as $$
A \triangle B \;=\; (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)
$$ or $$
A \triangle B \;=\; (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)
$$ while in practical proofs I find it much easier to work with $$
x \in A \triangle B \;\equiv\; x \in A \;\not\equiv\; x \in B
$$ for all $\;x\;$, since $\;\not\equiv\;$ is the logic-level equivalent of $\;\triangle\;$. 
 $\bullet\;$ The textbook definition of '$\;\mathscr T\text{ is a topology on }X\;$' is that \begin{align}
& \mathscr T \subseteq \mathscr P(X) \\
& \emptyset \in \mathscr T \\
& X \in \mathscr T \\
& \mathscr T\text{ is closed under }\cdots \cap \cdots \\
& \mathscr T\text{ is closed under }\bigcup \\
\end{align}  However, given closure under $\;\bigcup\;$, the first three conditions can be unified to just $$
\bigcup \mathscr T = X
$$ which has the very intuitive reading '$\;\mathscr T\;$ covers $\;X\;$'. 
 $\bullet\;$ In logic, I almost aways see the 'uniqueness quantifier' $\langle \exists! x :: P(x) \rangle$ ('there exists exactly one') defined as $$
\langle \exists x :: P(x) \rangle \;\land\; \langle \forall x,y : P(x) \land P(y) : x=y \rangle
$$ where $$
\langle \exists y :: \langle \forall x :: P(x) \;\equiv\; x = y \rangle \rangle
$$ is shorter and often seems much easier to work with.  And it has a nice symmetry: the $\;\then\;$ direction of the equivalence is uniqueness, which the $\;\when\;$ direction is existence. 
 $\bullet\;$ Finally, as an example from various domains, a statement of the form $\;P \equiv Q\;$ is very often seen as an invitation to give separate proofs for $\;P \then Q\;$ and $\;Q \then P\;$; and similarly for mutual inclusion for sets, and for proving equality of numbers using $\;\le\;$ and $\;\ge\;$, or even $\;\lt,=,\gt\;$. 
 
 The common pattern in all of the above, is that  people seem to prefer 'multi-part' definitions over 'unified' definitions.   And I'm wondering why this is. 
 Does a proof which is split in parts perhaps have a  proof-practical advantage?   As a kind of counterexample, a while ago I discovered that a relation $\;R\;$ on $\;A\;$ is an equivalence relation exactly when $$
aRb \:\equiv\: \langle \forall x :: aRx \equiv bRx\rangle
$$ holds for all $\;a,b\;$ (where $\;a,b,x\;$ range over $\;A\;$).  However, when I tried to actually use this definition to prove some relation to be an equivalence relation, then almost always the resulting proof was more complex than a proof of the three parts (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity).  So in this specific example, the 'unified' definition did not really help me.  But in my experience, this has been the exception: 'unified' definitions almost always really work in practice for me. 
 Do the parts perhaps have an  educational value?   Perhaps, at least initially, it is easier to build an intuition using separate parts, and then both those proofs and also later proofs are structured around that 'multi-part' intuition. 
 Is there perhaps an  'implicational bias'?   In other words, is it perhaps that I've been brought up in the 'school' of Dijkstra-Feijen, Gries-Schneider, et al., where there is an emphasis on equality and equivalence and symmetry, while most people approach proofs 'sequentially' based on inferences? 
 Or is something else at work here?

"I am trying to solve a differential equation:

subject to periodic boundary condition, whic would imply  $f(0)=f(2\pi)$  and  $f'(0)= f'(2\pi)$ . To solve this numerically, I have set up an equation:
 $$f_i = f_{i-1}+\frac{1}{c}(\theta_i-\theta_{i-1})\left(\max(\sin\theta_i,0)-f_{i-1}^4\right)~.$$  Now, I want to solve this for specific grids. Suppose, I set up my grid points in  $\theta = (0, 2\pi)$  to be  $n$  equally spaced floats. Then I have small python program which would calculate  $f$  for each grid points in  $\theta$ . Here is the program:

 My major problem is for small  $c$ , in the above case when  $c=0.03$ , the numerical equation does not converge to a reasonable value (it is highly oscillatory) if I choose  $N$  to be not so large. The main reason for that is since  $\frac{1}{c}*(\theta_i-\theta_{i-1})>1$ ,  $f$  tends to be driven to negative infinity when  $N$  is not so large, i.e.  $\theta_i-\theta_{i-1}$  is not so small. Here is an example with  $c=0.03$  showing the behaviour when  $N=100$  versus  $N=500$ . In my code, I have applied some adhoc criteria for small  $N$  to avoid divergences: 
 step = final_arr_n[i-1]+ 1./epsilon*2*np.pi/n*(max(np.sin(a[i]), 0) - final_arr_n[i-1]**4)
if (step>=0):
    final_arr_n[i] = step
else:
    final_arr_n[i] = 0.2*final_arr_n[i-1]

"Question: 
 
 A binary is defined as a tree in which 1 vertex is the root, and any other vertex has 2 or 0 children. A vertex with 0 children is called a node, and a vertex with 2 children is called an inner vertex. 
 The order between the children is important. 
 A binary tree can be defined with recursion:
a binary tree is one out of 2 options : 
 
 A single vertex. 
 A vertex in which two sub-trees, that were build before, are connected to him. 
 
 Now, let  $D_n$  be the number of  valid  binary trees, >with  $n$  inner vertices. 
 For this question, a binary tree is called  $valid$  if for each inner vertex  $v$ , the left sub-tree connected to  $v$  in the left side, contains an even amount (0,2,4,...) of inner vertices. 
 Find the recursive formula with starting conditions for  $D_n$  such that the formula can use all values before. In addition, calculate  $D_6$ . 
 
 
 $Solution.$  in order to build a valid binary tree of size  $n$  we can take all options for a valid binary tree of size  $n-1$  and take all options for a valid binary tree of size  $n-2$ . Therefore, we get:  $$D_n=D_{n-1}+D_{n-2}$$ 
 For the starting conditions: we consider  $D_1$  which is 1 because we have only the root, which has an even amount of inner vertices (0). 
 For  $D_2$  we have the next tree: 
 
 Therefore,  $D_2=1$ . 
 Calculation for  $D_6$ :  $$D_6=D_5+D_4=D_4+D_3+D_3+D_2=D_3+D_2+(D_2+D_1)\cdot 2 + D_2=D_2+D_1+D_2+2D_2+2D_1+D_2=5D_2 +3D_1=5+3=8 $$

"I have a short question about partial integration.

"I'm trying to calculate the improper Fresnel integral  $\int\limits_0^\infty\sin(x^2)dx$  calculation.
It uses several substitutions. There's one substitution that is not clear for me. 
 I could not understand how to get the right side from the left one. What subtitution is done here?  
 $$\int\limits_0^\infty\frac{v^2}{1+v^4} dv = \frac{1}{2}\int\limits_0^\infty\frac{1+u^2}{1+u^4} du.$$ 
 
 Fresnel integral calculation: 
 In the beginning put  $x^2=t$  and then:  $$\int\limits_0^\infty\sin(x^2) dx = \frac{1}{2}\int\limits_0^\infty\frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{t}}dt$$ 
 Then changing variable in Euler-Poisson integral we have:  $$\frac{2}{\sqrt\pi}\int_0^\infty e^{-tu^2}du =\frac{1}{\sqrt{t} }$$ 
 The next step is to put this integral instead of  $\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}$ .
 $$\int\limits_0^\infty\sin(x^2)dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt\pi}\int\limits_0^\infty\sin(t)\int_0^\infty\ e^{-tu^2}dudt = \frac{1}{\sqrt\pi}\int\limits_0^\infty\int\limits_0^\infty \sin (t) e^{-tu^2}dtdu$$  
And the inner integral   $\int\limits_0^\infty \sin (t) e^{-tu^2}dt$  is equal to  $\frac{1}{1+u^4}$ . 
 The next calculation:  $$\int\limits_0^\infty \frac{du}{1+u^4} = \int\limits_0^\infty \frac{v^2dv}{1+v^4} = \frac{1}{2}\int\limits_0^\infty\frac{1+u^2}{1+u^4} du = \frac{1}{2} \int\limits_0^\infty\frac{d(u-\frac{1}{u})}{u^2+\frac{1}{u^2}} $$ 
 $$= \frac{1}{2} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{ds}{2+s^2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}\arctan\frac{s}{\sqrt2} \Big|_{-\infty}^\infty = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt2} $$ 
 In this calculation the Dirichle's test is needed to check the integral  $\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{t}}dt$  convergence. It's needed also to substantiate the reversing the order of integration ( $dudt = dtdu$ ). All these integrals exist in a Lebesgue sense, and Tonelli theorem justifies reversing the order of integration.  
 The final result is  $$\frac{1}{\sqrt\pi}\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt2}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt\frac{\pi}{2}$$

"We have a 3D cylinder with a radius of $r = 1$ and a height of $h = 2$.  
 
 Now, we pick two random points on the edges of the cylinder - one for the top and one for the bottom circle. By connecting the two dots with a line what we can do next is calculate the angle between the line and the vertical z-axis. 
 We repeat this procedure $N$-times and collect all the random angles.  
 What can we say for sure?  
 
 The minimum angle should be $0$°, the case where we pick two points laying on top of each other giving us a parallel line to the z-axis.  
 The maximum angle should be $45$° - which is decided for us by $r$ and $h$. 
 
 
 My question here is what distribution of angles we should get. Running an experiment will give me the following distribution: 
 
 Which is a bit counter intuitive - at least to me - I expected a uniform distribution to be honest. So, I do hope I did not make a mistake in my code, which is why I provide the experiment code below. 
 In any case I would be interested in whether this distribution makes sense and if it's possible to explain it. 
 One thing that surely is important:  np.random.rand()  draws uniform values $x \in [0,1]$ so the points on the edges ( v  and  w ) should be uniform too.

"I am trying to solve a problem form a workbook I found, I apologize in advanced for the notations and my grammar, since english is not my first language I might have some grammatical errors and some notation differences in my question.  
 Te  exercise states as follows: 
 Given $V$ oriented vector space, with internal product and a finite dimension n.  
 Fixing $\beta =\{e_1,...e_n\}$ orthonormal, positive oriented basis for V, and defining $e_i^{*}$ as $e_i$'s equivalent in the dual basis $\beta^*$. We define the hodge star as the linear operator $\star$: $\cup_p \Lambda^p(V^*) \to \cup_p \Lambda^p(V^*) $ that satisfies:  
 
 $\star(e_{i1}^{*}\land.....\land e_{ip}^{*})$ = $e_{j1}^{*}\land.....\land e_{jp}^{*}$ (Which means $\star(\Lambda^p(V^*)) \subset \Lambda^{n-p}(V^*)$) 
 $e_{i1}^{*}\land.....\land e_{ip}^{*}\land\star(e_{i1}^{*}\land.....\land e_{ip}^{*})= e_{1}^{*}\land.....\land e_{n}^{*}$ 
 
 Prove that this definition of $\star$ does not depend on the basis chosen, as long as the basis is orthonormal and positive oriented. 
 Okay... so this si what I thought, out of the definition and the linearity of $\star$ you can calculate $\star(w)$ in fucntion of the dual basis. Using that $\star$ is linear all you got to know is $\star(e_{i1}^{*}\land.....\land e_{ip}^{*})$ which using the propperties above will be of the form: 
 $\star(e_{i1}^{*}\land.....\land e_{ip}^{*})$ = $(-1)^{\lambda}\land_{j \in \{i_1,..,i_n\}^c}e_{j}^{*}$ (with the subindex ordered, from lowest to highest and $\lambda$ a calculable interger).  
 So I thought next on grabbing another basis $\{v_1,...,v_n\}$ of $V^*$ and calculate $\star(v_{i1}\land....\land v_{ip})$ and see if the two propperties apply (Using that $v_{i1}\land....\land v_{ip}$ can be written as an unique linear combination of the vectors $\{e_{i1}^{*}\land.....\land e_{ip}^{*}: 1\leq i_1<...<i_p\leq n \}$). 
 My problem is I do not know where to apply the orthogonality and the fact that the other basis is positive, so I am stuck at this point.  
 Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advanced. Sorry again, for my grammar.

 The integers 0 through 9 are written on ten pieces of paper and put in
   a bag. A piece of paper is chosen at random from the bag, the number
   is recorded, then replaced, and a second piece of paper is chosen and
   that number is also recorded. The two recorded numbers are written
   next to each other to make a two digit integer. The numbers 00,
   01,...,09 are not counted as two-digit integers. For example, if 3 and
   5 are chosen, then the number could be 35 or 53. If 0 and 6 are
   chosen, then there is only one possibility, which is 60. If 9 and 9
   are chosen, then there is only one possibility, which is 99. What is
   the probability of making 47? 
 
 The hint it gives is the following: 
 
 What are the smallest and largest numbers that could be made? And, to calculate the probabilities, in each case list the numbers that are possible. The smallest number that could be made is 10 and the largest number is 99, so there are 99 - 9 = 90 different possible two digit numbers. 
 
 So the answer is $\frac1{90}$ but I'm not sure I understand why. I'll lay out my logic and then hopefully someone can correct me where I go wrong. 
 So you can make $47$ two ways, you can draw a $4$ then a $7$, or a $7$ then a $4$. So an equation would look like:  
 $P(4)P(7) + P(7)P(4) = 2P(4)P(7) = 2\left(\frac1{10} * \frac1{10}\right) = \frac1{50}$  
 The help guide after answering the question only says this: 
 
 There is only one way to make 47, so the probability of making 47 is
   1/90

"I am trying to solve  $$xy''+2xy'+6e^xy=0,\space x>0$$  about  $x=0$  using Frobenius method. The question is from  Boyce & DiPrima . 
 I have found the exponents at singularity to be  $r_1=1$  and  $r_2=0$ . I have also found the series solution for  $r=1$  by substituting  $$y=x^r\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n$$  into the ODE and replacing  $e^x$  with its Taylor series: 
 $$x^r\sum_{n=-1}^\infty a_{n+1}(n+r+1)(n+r)x^n+2x^r\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n}(n+r)x^n + 6x^r\sum_{n=0}^\infty (a_{n}x^n) \times \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} = 0$$ 
 $$\dots$$ 
 $$a_1 = -a_0\frac{2r+6}{r(r+1)}$$ 
 $$a_2 = -a_0\frac{-\frac{(2r+8)(2r+6)}{r(r+1)}+6}{(r+2)(r+1)}$$ 
 $$\dots$$ 
 When I set  $r=1, a_0=1$  and calculate these coefficients, I get  $y_1=x\left(1-4x+\frac{17}{3}x^2-\frac{47}{12}x^3+\dots\right)$  which is correct (according to my book). 
 Now, to find the second solution (associated with  $r_2=0$ ), I use this equation:  $$y_2=c\ln(x)y_1(x) + x^{r_2}\sum{b_nx^n} \tag{1} \label{y2-form}$$ 
 I find  $$c = \lim_{r\rightarrow r_2}(r-r_2)a_1(r)=-\frac{2r_2+6}{r_2+1}=-6.$$ 
 This is also correct. But my results for  $b_n$  are wrong. To find them, I set  $a_0=r-r_2=r$ , find  $a_n(a_0=r, r)$  (by canceling the factors  $r$ ), and differentiate them with respect to  $r$ :  $$b_n=\left.\frac{d a_n(a_0=r, r)}{d r}\right\vert_{r=0}$$ 
 $$a_0 = r$$ 
 $$b_0 = \left.\frac{d r}{d r}\right\vert_{r=0} = 1$$ 
 $$b_1 = \left.\frac{d}{d r}\left(-\frac{2r+6}{r+1} \right)\right\vert_{r=0} = 4$$ 
 $$b_2 = \dots = -49$$ 
 These are completely wrong. The books says  $b_0 = 1, b_1 = 0, b_2 = -33, b_3 = \frac{449}{6}x^3, \dots$ 
 I have seen this method of finding  $b_n$  in a proof of Frobenius method in the book  An Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations  written by  Coddington . Did I get all this ""multiplying by  $(r-r_2)$  and differentiating"" thing wrong? Or maybe I am doing a silly mistake.  Boyce & DiPrima  suggests putting  $\eqref{y2-form}$  in the ODE and calculating the coefficients that way. But I want to understand what is wrong with the other method.

This is done by picking a point (big red dot), and using the vanishing points calculated by some other lines on the image, and a set width/height of the rectangle to calculate the other 3 points. This part works fine. 
 Now, I when I select another point (big blue dot), I can calculate the other points as well, I'm just stuck on getting the width/height to transform correctly. Currently, they are the same as the red rectangle, which is obviously wrong (blue rectangle) since they should be smaller closer to the vanishing point (green rectangle is the way I need it to be).   
 The image below is a sketch of my current situation. 
 I know the coordinates of some intersections on parallel lines in the plane (green dots), so I thought I could do some calculations with that (ie. you know the difference of the length of the horizontal lines in relation to the y-shift?), I just can't figure out the correct formula, should be something like a natural logarithm? (since the width/height should decrease exponentially i think as they approach the vanishing point?). 
 Note: I'm using a right handed coordinate system (my origin is at the top left corner, and the y-axis runs downward).

 The first row of the table gives the value of  $n=0,1,2,3,...$ . The first column gives the polygonal numbers  $P_{N}(n)$  starting with  $N=3$ . 
 Here's the pattern, the sum is done by adding elements of the same column starting with the triangular numbers.

2-Do we know why we have such a pattern? 
 Edit 03-05-2019 
 Following the suggestion of Eleven-Eleven, I looked for other patterns similar to the one above. I found one that is even simpler. This time we skip the triangular numbers when we calculate the sum. We start with the squares and sum up enough terms to get another square. 
 $$1=1^2=T_{1}^2$$ 
 $$4+5=3^2=9=T_{2}^2$$ 
 $$9+12+15=6^2=36=T_{3}^2$$ 
 $$16+22+28+34=10^2=100=T_{4}^2$$ 
 $$25+35+45+55+65=15^2=225=T_{5}^2$$ 
 We see the same pattern as above. The square with index  $(n+1)$  requires the addition of one more term than the square with index  $n$ . The number of elements to sum up to get the square  $T_{n}^2$  is simply  $n$ .   
 Can this be stated as the following theorem?   
 The square of a triangular number  $T_{n}$  can be expressed as the sum of  $n$  polygonal numbers excluding the triangular number itself.

"Lots of people throw coin until get a tail. It means each person should immediately stop, when get exactly one tail. The odds of someone having a head or a tail on any given throw is equal. 
 Each person  will have a sequence of zero or more heads followed by a single tail.  
 That is, if ""H"" indicates a head and ""T"" indicates a tail, the sequence of results will look like one of: 
 
 T 
 HT 
 HHT 
 HHHT 
 HHHHT 
 And so on 
 
 Question 
 What will the ratio of heads and tails be on very large N? 
 My thought:  we could say that sequences have the following probabilities: 
 P(T)     = 1/2;  Tails_Count = 1
P(HT)    = 1/4;  Tails_Count = 2
P(HHT)   = 1/8;  Tails_Count = 3
P(HHHT)  = 1/16; Tails_Count = 4
P(HHHHT) = 1/32; Tails_Count = 5
And so on
 
 We know that each person will have exactly 1 tail. I'm confused about how to calculate heads average count. 
 If only two person throw coins, than one person can get sequence like HT and the second person can get sequence like HHHHHHHHHT. 
 It means that we have 10H and 2T. 
 On the other hand probability of getting HHHHHHHHHHT is $${1 \ \over 2^{10}}$$
 which is almost impossible. 
 Staring this momment I have no idea how to caculate ratio of heads and tails.

"I am working thru Axler’s “Linear Algebra Done Right.”  I am okay with the math, but I’m losing sight of the forest.   
 Like all books on linear algebra, there’s a lot of time and energy spent on finding, proving existence of, and interpreting matrices with “lots of zeros” - that is, matrices with as many zeros as possible given some particular vector space and transformation. But I cannot see why a simple matrix generally, or one with lots of 0’s in particular, is very important. 
 Furthermore, discussions of matrices with lots of zeros closely correspond to discussions of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (or generalized eigenvectors) of the transformation.  I see why eigenvectors and values are important for understanding a transformation, but we certainly don’t need a simple matrix to calculate the eigenvalues and vectors. 
 So, why are we spending so much time and energy finding matrices of the transformations with lots of zeros, and especially how such matrices relate to eigenvalues? 
 Given my lack of understanding as to why linear algebra procedes along this course, my question is necessarily vague.  Consequently, I am hoping only for a discussion of the issues, more so than specific mathematical derivations. 
 (Followup in response to comments):   And even if a sparse matrix allows easier computations, don’t the computations needed to find that sparse matrix generally negate any benefit?

"This might not be the best place to ask this question, but here it goes... I'm creating a game and need 3D sea waves. Since it's for mobiles, there's no time to generate entire screen worth of waves on every frame, so I figured I'll create a pattern and copy it over and over again. I created a function $h(x,y,time)$ which returns $z$ coordinate of point $T(x,y)$ where $x\in[0,m\rangle\cap\mathbb{N}$ and $y\in[0,n\rangle\cap\mathbb{N}$ based on modified  simplex noise  algorithm. 
 I had difficulty visualising algorithm for 3D waves, so I started with a simple graph plot, where y is the height of the wave. By running simplified function $h$ as $h(x)$, I get something like this: 
 
 Obviously, this is no good. You can clearly see that the pattern doesn't smoothly fade into next instance. Therefore, I calculated $y$ coordinate as
$$y=h(x)\cdot(1-\frac{x}{m})+h(x-m)\cdot\frac{x}{m}$$ 
 This results in something like this: 
 
 It was good enough for me, so I attempted to expand it to 3D space. My math and logic seem non-existant from this point on, as the best I could come up with is this: 
 if (y-x < 0) then  $A(x-y,0),B(m,n-x+y)$ 
 else  $A(0,y-x),B(m+x-y,n)$ 
 $$f=\frac{\sqrt{(A_x-x)^2+(A_y-y)^2}}{\sqrt{(A_x-B_x)^2+(A_y-B_y)^2}}$$ 
 $$z=h(x,y,0)\cdot(1-f)+h(x-m,y-n,0)\cdot f$$ 
 This fails terribly. Here's the result of that expression - blue square is a $z=0$ plane. You can clearly see that the pattern doesn't blend smoothly. 
 
 I know that the expression should fail, but am unable to come up with a working expression. How can I make the function repeat itself smoothly like in the 2D example on both x and y axes? 
 Thanks in advance, Mirac7 
 
 EDIT: I've come up with the expression which should calculate height correctly. 
 $$z=\big(h(x,y,0)\cdot(1-\frac{x}{m})+h(x-m,y,0)\cdot\frac{x}{m}\big)\cdot(1-\frac{y}{n})+\big(h(x,y-n,0)\cdot(1-\frac{x}{m})+h(x-m,y-n,0)\cdot\frac{x}{m}\big)\cdot\frac{y}{n}$$ 
 The result of this expression is this: 
 
 It's still not quite there. When I increase the $m$ and $n$, thereby gaining more precision from every point, I get smoother transition. I need to set $m,n$ to at least 128 points to get somewhat smooth transition, which is way too many to be calculated per frame. 
 But another problem occurred. It is barely noticeable in the above rendering, but here's what heightmap of some tiny waves with $m,n=128$ looks like:

 I appreciate a response, especially at level of high school or first year university (did not do math past first year university).  Thank you.

"Questions: 
 (A) Calculate 
 $$\lim_{x \to \frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\cot x}{2x - \pi}$$ 
 (B) Calculate 
 $$\lim_{x ~\to~0^{+}} x^{3}e^{\frac{1}{x}}$$ 
 without using L'Hospital's Rule. 
 Attempted solution: 
 (A) 
 Using the definition of $\cot x$ gives: 
 $$\lim_{x \to \frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\cot x}{2x - \pi} = \lim_{x \to \frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}}{2x - \pi} = \lim_{x \to \frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{\sin x} \cdot \frac{\cos x}{2x - \pi}$$ 
 Since the first term will turn out to be 1, I carry on without it and making the substitution $y = x - \frac{\pi}{2}$ as well as the fact that $\cos x = \cos (-x)$: 
 $$= \lim_{y \to 0} \frac{\cos (y+\frac{\pi}{2})}{2y} = \lim_{y \to 0} \frac{\cos (-y-\frac{\pi}{2})}{2y}$$ 
 Using the subtraction formula for cosine gives: 
 $$ = \lim_{y \to 0} \frac{\cos(-y) \cos \frac{\pi}{2} + \sin(-y) \sin{\frac{\pi}{2}}}{2y} = \lim_{y \to 0} \frac{\sin(-y)}{2y} =$$
$$ \lim_{y \to 0} \frac{- \sin(y)}{2y} = -\frac{1}{2}\lim_{y \to 0} \frac{\sin(y)}{y} = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = -\frac{1}{2}$$ 
 Does this look reasonable? 
 (B) 
 I know that the limit does not exist (it ""becomes"" $\infty$). I figure that $e^{x}$ is continuous function with respect to x and so: 
 $$\lim_{x ~\to~0^{+}} x^{3}e^{\frac{1}{x}} = \lim_{x ~\to~0^{+}} x^{3} \cdot \lim_{x ~\to~0^{+}} e^{\frac{1}{x}} = 0 \cdot e^{\lim_{x ~\to~0^{+}} \frac{1}{x}} $$ 
 I am not sure where to go on from here. Will it be an argument based on $\frac{1}{x}$ growing faster towards infinity than $x^3$ shrinks towards $0$? Or is there a smart algebraic trick that can be used? 
 In many cases, the limit appears to give a ""zero times infinity"" expression, but after figuring out the secret steps you can change it to something that you can calculate the limit from. How do you know when to stop trying and declare that the limit does not exist?

"Consider the classic Monty Hall Problem, but with four doors, labelled A, B, C, and D. 
 I want to calculate the probability of winning with the strategy ""choose, switch, stick"". I'm struggling to get from maths I think is right to the agreed upon answer, so was hoping someone could help. 
 I start off by picking door A. Door B is opened, so my probability distribution is as follows: 
 A(1/4), B(0), C(3/8), D(3/8) 
 This makes sense as I learnt nothing about door A, and door C and D share the remaining probability. 
 I then switch arbitrarily to C (C and D are indifferent). At this point, Monty will either open door A or door D. 
 If Monty opens door A, I propose the following distribution: 
 A(0), B(0), C(1/2), D(1/2) 
 On the other hand, if Monty opens door D: 
 A(4/7), B(0), C(3/7), D(0) 
 To calculate the probability of my strategy succeeding, I then need to combine the probability of winning depending on which door was opened. 
 From my understanding, this should be 3/8:  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MontyHallProblem.html . However, I haven't reached this answer regardless of how I try to combine the two scenarios.

 Let $X$ be a Hilbert space and let $\psi_1,\psi_2$ be linearly independent vectors and let $\varphi_1,\varphi_2$ be linearly independent  vectors in $X$. Define the operator $T$ in $B(X)$ by$$Tx=\langle x;{\varphi_1}\rangle\psi_1+\langle x;{\varphi_2}\rangle\psi_2,\quad x\in X.$$ Determine the spectrum $\sigma(T)$ and calculate $(T-\lambda)^{-1}, \lambda\notin\sigma(T).$  
 
 I started with: $\sigma(T)=\{\lambda\in\mathbb C\mid T-\lambda I \text{ is not invertible}\}$. So I tried to find values of $\lambda$ for which $T-\lambda I$ is invertible and my answer would be $\mathbb C$ without those values.

 Note that I am not looking for a solution, just a general advice on how to approach these questions and practical tips. 
 We've just started differentiability and I'm completely lost. I'm asked to calculate the value of  $f'(x)$  at  $x_0$  or prove it doesn't exist. But we haven't done much practice and only focused on theorems so far so I'm not sure how to approach these questions. 
 Are there any special tricks regarding calculating differential function limits or is it basically the same as ordinary limits? 
 $f\left(x\right)\ =\ \left|x^{2}-3x-4\right|,\ \ \ x_{0}=4$ 
 $\lim _{x\to 4}\frac{\left(f\left(x\right)-f\left(4\right)\right)}{x-4} =\ \lim _{x\to 4}\frac{\left|x^2-3x-4\right|-0}{x-4}$ 
 $\lim _{x\to 4^+}\frac{x^2-3x-4}{x-4} =\ \lim _{x\to 4^+}\frac{\left(x-4\right)\left(x-3\right)+4x-16}{x-4} =\ \lim _{x\to 4^+}\frac{\left(x-4\right)\left(x-3\right)+4\left(x-4\right)}{x-4} $ 
 $=\ \lim _{x\to 4^+}\left(x-3\right)+4 =\ \lim _{x\to 4^+}\left(4-3\right)+4 = 5$ 
 $\lim _{x\to 4^-}\frac{-x^2+3x+4}{x-4} =\ \lim _{x\to 4^-}\frac{\left(x-4\right)\left(3-x\right)-4x+16}{x-4} =\ \lim _{x\to 4^-}\frac{\left(x-4\right)\left(3-x\right)-4\left(x-4\right)}{x-4} $ 
 $=\ \lim _{x\to 4^-}\left(3-x\right)-4 = \left(3-4\right)-4 = -5$ 
 Therefore the limit doesn't exists, and f is not differentiable at 4. 
 b. 
 $f\left(x\right)\ =\ \sqrt[3]{x^{2}-\left|x\right|},\ \ x_{0}\ =0$ 
 $\lim \:_{x\to \:0}\frac{\left(f\left(x\right)-f\left(0\right)\right)}{x-0} =\ \lim \:_{x\to \:0}\frac{\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2-x}-0\right)}{x}$ 
 $\lim _{x\to 0^+}\frac{\sqrt[3]{x^2-x}}{x}\cdot \frac{\sqrt[\frac{2}{3}]{x^2-x}}{\sqrt[\frac{2}{3}]{x^2-\:x}}=\lim \:_{x\to 0^+}\frac{\left(x^2-x\right)}{x\left(\sqrt[\frac{2}{3}]{x^2-\:x}\right)}=\lim \:_{x\to \:0^+}\frac{x-1}{\sqrt[\frac{2}{3}]{x^2-\:x}}=\frac{0-1}{\sqrt[\frac{2}{3}]{0^+}}=-∞$ 
 A one sided limit doesn't exist, therefore f is not diffirintable at 0. 
 c. 
 $f\left(x\right)=
 \begin{cases} 
      \frac{\sin x^{2}}{x} & if \ x ≠ 0\\
       0 & if \ x = 0 \\

\
, \ x_{0}\ =\ 0$ 
 $\lim \:\:_{x\to \:\:0}\frac{\left(f\left(x\right)-f\left(0\right)\right)}{x-0} =\ \lim \:\:_{x\to \:\:0^{ }}\frac{f\left(x\right)}{x}
$ 
 $\lim _{x\to 0^+}\frac{\left(\frac{sin\left(x^2\right)}{x}\right)}{x}=\lim \:_{x\to 0^+}\left(\frac{sin\left(x^2\right)}{x^2}\right)=1$ 
 $\lim _{x\to 0^-}\frac{\left(\frac{sin\left(x^2\right)}{x}\right)}{x}=\lim \:_{x\to 0^-}\left(\frac{sin\left(x^2\right)}{x^2}\right)=1$

 $ e_r = \frac{\bar e_r}{\| \bar e_r\|} = (\cos \phi \sin \theta, \sin \phi \sin \theta, \cos \theta)$   
 $ e_\phi = \frac{\bar e_r}{\| \bar e_r\|} = (-r\sin \phi \sin \theta, r\cos \phi \sin \theta, 0)$ 
 $ e_\theta = \frac{\bar e_r}{\| \bar e_r\|} = (r \cos \phi \cos \theta, r \sin \phi \cos \theta, -r\sin \theta)$ 
 Let  $w_r, w_\phi , w_\theta$  be corresponding basis in  $T^*$ . Then 
 $dr = w_r$ 
 $d\phi = \frac{1}{r\sin \theta} w_\phi$   
 $d\theta = \frac{1}{r} w_\theta$

 $$ + F^3_\phi \frac{1}{r\sin \theta} w_\phi \wedge w_\theta + F^3_r w_r \wedge w_\theta$$ 
 
 $$ = (F^2_r - F^1_\phi \frac{1}{r\sin \theta}) w_r \wedge w_\phi$$ 
 $$ + (F^3_r - F^1_\theta \frac{1}{r}) w_r \wedge w_\theta$$ 
 $$ + (F^3_\phi \frac{1}{r\sin \theta} - F^2_\theta \frac{1}{r}) w_\phi \wedge w_\theta$$

"Given a set of points on a sphere, how can I implement a higher order low pass filter on them? 
 At the moment, I am just multiplying the vectors from the input and output set by their weights and summing them, component-wise. While this works well when the angles are small, the filter response isn't right as the angles get larger than 30 degrees. It needs to perfectly compliment the response of a high pass filtered gyroscope, which works with angles, not vectors.  
 What I'm essentially looking for is an interpolation method for multiple (in my case 8) weighted points on a sphere. The sum of all weights is one. The algorithm needs to be such, that if it were applied to only two vectors $a$ and $b$, with the weights $(1 - t)$ and $(t)$ respectively, a constant rate of change in  t  would result in a constant  angular  rate of change in the output. Say, for example we had as our two vectors $a = (1, 0, 0)$ and $b = (0, 1, 0)$, the angle  ab  is 90 degrees. If we set $t$ to $1/3$, we should expect the result, $c$, to be 30 degrees away from $a$. If we use the standard vector multiplication rules to calculate $c$ as $a*(1 - t) + b*t$, the angle between $a$ and $c$ is closer to 22 degrees. This error gets worse as the angle $ab$ increases. I know that the slerp algorithm exists for just two points, but I need one that works on any number of points. 
 The problem is that standard linear interpolation between points on a sphere represented as vectors, does not interpolate correctly when you look at the angles.

"Note:  Although adding zero has usually no effect, there is sometimes a situation where it is the  essence  of a calculation which drives the development into a surprisingly fruitful direction. Here is one example of what I mean. 
 
 The  Goulden-Jackson Cluster Method  counts words built from a finite alphabet which are not allowed to contain so-called  bad words . This method nicely presented (and something to chuckling about) by J. Noonan and D. Zeilberger is very efficient and the reason for it's efficiency is due to a clever addition of zeros. 
 Let's denote the alphabet $V$, the language $\mathcal{L}$ and let $B$ be the set of  bad words . Since we want to work with generating functions, we introduce weights on words $$weight(w):=s^{length(w)}$$ 
 The generating function $f(s)$ is the weight enumerator of the set of  valid  words $\mathcal{L}(B)$ that avoids the members of $B$ as factors (i.e. substrings). We obtain
  \begin{align*}
f(s)=\sum_{w\in\mathcal{L}(B)}weight(w)
\end{align*} 
 
 It turns out according to the first section in the referred paper that counting these words is a cumbersome job. In fact we can do it much better and the trick is to add $0$ to both sides and 
 
 rewrite this expression as
  \begin{align*}
f(s)=\sum_{w\in V^*}weight(w)0^{[\text{number of factors of }w\text{ that belong to }B]}
\end{align*}
  and then use the following  deep facts  (wording from the paper :-) )
  \begin{align*}
0&=1+(-1)\\
0^r&=
\begin{cases}
1,&\text{if }r=0\\
0,&\text{if }r>0
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
  and for any finite set $A$,
  \begin{align*}
\prod_{a\in A}0=\prod_{a\in A}(1+(-1))=\sum_{S\subset A}(-1)^{|S|}
\end{align*}
  where $|S|$ denotes the cardinality of $S$. 
 
 We now have
\begin{align*}
f(s)&=\sum_{w\in V^*}weight(w)0^{[\text{number of factors of }w\text{ that belong to }B]}\\
&=\sum_{w\in V^*}weight(w)(1+(-1))^{[\text{number of factors of }w\text{ that belong to }B]}\\
&=\sum_{w\in V^*}\sum_{S\subset\text{Bad}(w)}(-1)^{|S|}s^{\text{length}(w)}
\end{align*}
where Bad$(w)$ is the set of factors of $w$ that belong to $B$. 
 This clever usage of the  Inclusion-exclusion principle 
is a much more superior approach to calculate the valid words not containing any bad factors and the essence was to add zero in order to introduce the IEP. 
 
 So, my question is: Do you know from other situations where cleverly adding $0$ or multiplying with $1$ opens up a door to solve a problem.

Why is it that for this distribution we have to take the limit and cannot evaluate at 0. Whereas for other distributions we can evaluate at 0 directly. Is this an issue that arises because of swapping the derivative with the integral because  $$\frac{d}{ds}\int e^{sx}f(x)dx\big|_{s=0}= \int\frac{d}{ds} e^{sx}f(x)dx\big|_{s=0}= \int xe^{sx}f(x)dx\big|_{s=0}=\int xf(x)dx $$  seems to imply that we should be able to evaulate at 0 for all distributions including the uniform. So the trouble of not being able to evaluate at 0 should not arise.

 I've been stuck on this related rates problem for a while now and I just can't figure out how to even approach it. The problem goes something like this: 
 The above diagram shows two objects moving at different speeds. Both objects are 0.5 miles from the origin. The blue object is moving at 50mph. The straight-line distance between the blue object and the red object is increasing at a rate of 35 mph. Find the speed of the red object. 
 I tried to solve it using Pythagorean Theorem and finding the derivative of the top side of the triangle. Anyway, I ended up getting a negative number, and even ignoring the sign, the answer I got was obviously wrong. I know the speed of the red object is obviously greater than the blue object because the distance between the objects is increasing. I just really don't know how to calculate the magnitude of said number.
