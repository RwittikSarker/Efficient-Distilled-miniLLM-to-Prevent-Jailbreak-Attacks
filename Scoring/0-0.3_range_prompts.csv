  $$x^2 = \frac{x-y}{x+y},$$ calculate the derivative $y'$. 
 
 So I found the derivative by applying quotient rule on the right side, and power rule on the left and separated $dy/dx$. 
 The answer was: $$y'(x) = -x^2 - 2 x y + \frac{y}{x} - y^2.$$

"Consider tossing a fair coin once followed by rolling a fair die, however the die is rolled once only when we get a head in the preceding toss.  Need to find out probability of getting a six or a tail. I could derive the answer rather mechanically using a tree diagram. But I'm looking for a more convincing solution perhaps using set notation and formula. Any help would be much appreciated. 
 Elaboration of my attempt and confusion: 
 
 Sample space $\Omega=\{\{H,1\}, \{H,2\}, \{H,3\}, \{H,4\}, \{H,5\}, \{H,6\}, \{T\}\} $   [note that all sample points are not equi-dimensional] 
  Events are defined for the same sample space as follows: 
  $A=$the event that we get a H in the toss, i.e. all 6 points starting with H 
  $B=$the event that we get a six in the roll of a die i.e. a single point ending with 6 
  $C=$the event that we get a T in the toss i.e. a single point with T 
  $ℙ$(getting a six or a tail) = $ℙ(B∪C)  = ℙ(B) + ℙ(C) - ℙ(B∩C) = ℙ(B) + ℙ(C) –  0$ 
  However, at this point, I’m not sure how to proceed further to calculate $ℙ(B)$?  One, thought could be replacing $B$ with $\{H,6\}$ i.e. $ℙ(B) = ℙ(\{H\}∩\{6\})$. However, here I’ve two confusions –  (1) If I use events like $\{H\}$ and $\{6\}$, then they are scoped within respective sub-experiments of tossing and rolling. Moreover, such decomposition is allowed only-when the final space $\Omega$ can be expressed as Cartesian product space $S_1\times S_2$ where $S_1=$ sample space of tossing and $S_2=$sample space for rolling
   (2) How can I define another event say $B^1$ in $\Omega$, such that  $B=\{A \cap B^1 \}$

"I'm a programmer, not a mathematician, but I've got a real-world problem I'm trying to solve that's out of my league, and my Google skills so far have failed me. 
 I have an analog waveform that's been sampled, part of which contains a sine wave, as shown below:
 
The sample rate of the data and the frequency of the sine wave are both constant, but unrelated. I need to take this sampled waveform, and ""upsample"" it, IE, generate more samples between the existing sample points. To do this, I've been using Cubic Spline Interpolation. I've taken an existing C++ library from the following location:  http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/ . The formulas are given on the page. I pass in the existing sampled data as control points, with ""X"" set to the sample number, and ""Y"" set to the sample value. Given an input value of X, this library generates me the corresponding ""Y"" value, so passing in an X of 2.5 would generate a value on the generated spline halfway between samples 2 and 3. All of this is working great so far, and it yields a waveform like the one shown above, but I now need to do one extra thing that I'm a bit stuck on. 
 What I need to be able to do now is ""synchronize"" with the the sine wave in the sample data. To do that, I want to detect the point at which the sine wave crosses a given threshold, as shown below:
 
In other words, given a starting value of X, I want to calculate the next X value at which Y equals a given value. Currently I ""brute force"" an approximate solution, by incrementing by a given step size between two X values until I cross the threshold point. There are two problems with this: 
 
 Accuracy. The solution is only approximate, and I need a highly accurate result. This leads to a very small step size, while still having a margin of error. 
 Performance. I have literally billions of these operations to perform, and I want something that can evaluate in a reasonable period of time. Right now I have to trade off accuracy to improve performance. 
 
 Instead of using an imperfect brute force search like I currently do, I was wondering if there's a mathematical solution for this problem. I basically want a function that given an X start position and a target Y sample value, will return the next X where Y is equal to the target Y value. I believe this should be possible to achieve, but I lack the math skills to derive the formula myself. Can anyone tell me if such a function is theoretically possible to write, and if so, what a possible implementation would be? 
 Here are some potentially useful constraints on my input data, which any acceptable solution can assume: 
 
 The X coordinates of control points are linearly increasing values (IE, all evenly spaced and never ""doubling back"") 
 I know the upper and lower bounds for the X and Y coordinates of the control points when generating the spline

"First the definition of the inner and outer product in terms of grade projection:

 Let  $ X = \mathbb{P}^{2} $  then  $ \operatorname{Cl}X = \mathbb{Z}, $  with generator  $ L, $  the class containing all the lines of  $ \mathbb{P}^{2}. $  If  $ C \subset \mathbb{P}^{2} $  has degree  $ n $  then  $ C \sim nL. $  In view of  $ K = -3L $  and  $ L^{2} = 1, $  in this case the adjunction formula  yields  $$ g = \frac{n(n-3)}{2} + 1 = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{3}. $$ 
 
 (1) I'm not sure why  $ C $  is linearly equivalent to  $ nL. $   
 (2) I don't really see why  $ K = -3L, $  because I don't know how to calculate  $ K_{X} $  for  $ X = \mathbb{P}^{2}. $  I know that the canonical class  $ K_{X} = \operatorname{dim}_{k}\Omega^{n}(X), $  but I'm not sure where to go from here.

"I am wondering if there is a closed form for finding the expected value or variance for a conditional exponential distribution. 
 For example:

 Same question for variance. 
 What about for a joint distribution of independent exponentials? 
 $$ E(X|y > a) $$ where X is exponential with mean $\lambda$, Y is exponential with mean $\theta$ and X & Y are independent. 
 A sample problem for the actuarial P/1 exam (#124 for those also studying) asks: 
 
 The joint probability for $f(x,y) = 2e^{-x-2y}, ~ x > 0, ~ y > 0$. Calculate the variance of Y given $x > 3, ~ y > 3$. 
 
 The solution goes like this: (Math on the right, reasoning on the left) 
 
 
 $Var (Y|x>3, y>3) =$ 
 $Var (Y|x>3) = ~~~~~$Independence 
 $Var (Y + 3) = ~~~~~$Memoryless 
 $Var (Y) + Var (3) =~~~~~$Independence of Y and 3. 
 $Var (Y) = ~~~~~ $ Since $Var (3) = 0$. 
 $0.25 ~~~~~ $Exponential Variance, $\lambda = 2$. 
 
 
 So this says to me that  $Var (Y|x>3) = Var (Y)$.   Is that true?  If so, is it always true?  If not, then how does this solution work? 
 Could one also replace E(Y) for Steps 1 - 4, Use $E(a) = a$ and get $E(Y| y>a) = E(y) + a$?

 $$\int e^{itx} (1-|x|)_+ ~dx = \int_{-1}^1 e^{itx} (1-|x|) ~dx $$
By integration by parts $\left( u(x) = 1-|x| \rightarrow u'(x) = -\frac{x}{|x|}, ~v'(x) = e^{itx} \rightarrow v(x) = \frac{1}{it}e^{itx} \right) $

 What is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation  $A \mapsto (|A|, U$ )? I.e., what is  $J$  such that the following equation holds: 
 $$ \int_{A\in \mathrm{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})}f(A)\mathrm{d}{A} = \int_{P\geq0,U^\ast U\,\mathrm{idempotent}}f(P U)|\det(J(P,U))|\mathrm{d}{P}\mathrm{d}{U}$$ 
 I tried to calcualte it but I'm not getting anything simple. In particular, I've written  $A = A_R + i A_I$  with  $A_R = \frac{1}{2}(A+A^\ast); A_I = \frac{1}{2i}(A-A^\ast)$  so that  $A$  is parametrized by two self-adjoint matrices. In turn, we may write  $|A| = \exp(H_1) ; U = \exp(i H_2)$  for two self-adjoint matrices  $H_1,H_2$  (assuming for a moment that  $A$  is invertible so that  $U$  is actually unitary). Hence we want to calculate the Jacobian of the transformation  $(H_1,H_2)\mapsto(A_R,A_I)$  from  $\mathrm{Herm}_n(\mathbb{C})^2\to \mathrm{Herm}_n(\mathbb{C})^2$ . 
 This, however, starts to get ugly, with the differential of the exponential map for example being given by functional calculus of the adjoint super operator ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_of_the_exponential_map ) and having to use the determinant of a block matrix formula.  
 Is there an easier way out? 
 
 Possible solution: 
 In  Edelman's PhD thesis  there are given Jacobians to get from a matrix A to its  LQ decomposition , and from its LQ decomposition to its  Cholesky decomposition  (Theorem 3.1). This possibly solves the problem as follows:  
 \begin{align} \int_{A\in \mathrm{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})}f(A)\mathrm{d}{A} &= \int_{L\text{ lower triangular},\,U\text{ unitary}} f(LU)\prod_{i=1}^{n}L_{ii}^{2n-2i+1}\mathrm{d}{L}\mathrm{d}{U} \\ &=2^{-n}\int_{P\geq0,\,U\text{ unitary}} f(\sqrt{P}U)\mathrm{d}{P}\mathrm{d}{U}\\&=2^{-n}\int_{P\geq0,\,U\text{ unitary}} f(PU)|\det(P\otimes I+I\otimes P^\ast)|^2\mathrm{d}{P}\mathrm{d}{U}\\&=2^{-n}\int_{P\geq0,\,U\text{ unitary}} f(PU)\prod_{1\leq i,j\leq n}(\lambda_i(P)+\lambda_j(P))^2\mathrm{d}{P}\mathrm{d}{U}\end{align} 
 with the usual abuse of notation that  $\mathrm{d}{L}$  integrates only over the non-zero elements of  $L$ ,  $\mathrm{d}{U}$  is the volume element within the unitary group, and  $\mathrm{d}{P}$  the volume element on self-adjoint matrices (so only  $n$  real and  $\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$  complex matrix elements).  $\lambda_j(P)$  is the  $j$ th eigenvalue of the matrix  $P$ . 
 Remaining question : Why is the LQ-decomposition change of variables valid for complex matrices? A complex unitary  $n\times n$  matrix is  $n^2$  real parameters, whereas a lower triangular matrix is  $n(n+1)$  real parameters. On the other hand, a complex matrix is  $2n^2$  real parameters, so there seem to be  $n$  real parameters too many in this decomposition? (This is not a problem if matrices have real entries). Note that for the Cholesky decomposition this is not an issue since then the lower triangular matrix has positive entries on its diagonal.  
 Could it be possible to make an LQ decomposition for complex matrices where the lower triangular has positive entries on the diagonal? Is this what Edelman is referring to? 
 Unfortunately, precisely for the complex LQ decomposition he does not give a reference nor a proof.

"In preparation for finals, I am trying to calculate $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int\limits_0^\infty \frac{n^2 \sin(x/n)}{n^3x + x(1 + x^3)} \, d x$$ with proof.  
 Here is my approach/what I have done so far: 
If we can find a dominating function, we have $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int\limits_0^\infty \frac{n^2 \sin(x/n)}{n^3x + x(1 + x^3)} \, d x = \int\limits_0^\infty \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}  \frac{n^2 \sin(x/n)}{n^3x + x(1 + x^3)} \, d x$$ by the Dominated Convergence Theorem. If we let $f_{n} = \frac{n^2 \sin(x/n)}{n^3x + x(1 + x^3)}$, then $f_{n}(x)$ converges to $0$ for all $x > 0$, which implies the limit is equal to 0 because the Dominated Convergence Theorem only requires a.e. convergence (so not having convergence at $x = 0$ is no issue). Operating under the assumption that dominating function exists, is this correct?  
 As far as finding a dominating function is concerned, we have 
$$ 
|f_{n}| = \left| \frac{n^2 \sin(x/n)}{n^3x + x(1 + x^3)} \right| = \frac{|n^2 \sin(n/x)|}{n^3x + x(1 + x^3)} \leq \frac{n^2}{n^3x + x(1 + x^3)},
$$
which is where I get stuck. The two directions that seemed the most clear from here was to either 
$$ 
\frac{n^2}{n^3x + x(1 + x^3)} \leq\frac{n^2}{n^3x} = \frac{1}{x} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{n^2}{n^3x + x(1 + x^3)} \leq \frac{n^2}{x(1 + x^3)}.

The former is not integrable and I cannot seem to grapple with the $n^2$ on the latter and sufficiently bound it. So my main question is how can I bound $|f_{n}|$?

 Hence,  $e^{x^2}=\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{k!}x^{2k} +\frac{x^{2n+1}e^{\theta x^2}}{(n+1)!}$ 
 Comparing terms with the general Maclaurin polynomial, we get that: 
 $\frac{1}{k!}x^{2k} = \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^{n}$

 In fact, the problem is this. 
 I sell the good at  $100 + 20% VAT = $120 : this is the end price. 
 To calculate my earnings I have to do: 
 $120 (end price) - ($100 - 20% VAT) = $100 (price without VAT) =

"I have the following problem. 
 
 You apply for jobs and know that if you send your application then every job appointment procedure has two stages:  
 
 You can be either invited or not invited to a personal interview and then  
 You can either be selected or not selected for a job.  
 
 Assuming that you do not have any further information about the process and the selection criteria, please compute the a priori probability to get  at least one job  offer after sending your application to  three different places . 
 
 My thoughts 
 I started thinking about what events are independent and which ones are dependent. 
 I thought that being able to get a job from place $A$ is an independent event of being able to get a job from place $B$. For this reason, I decided to consider independently the problem  what is the probability of getting a job from a place $X$ . 
 Now, the probability of  being called to go to the interview  (lets call this event $I$) is $\frac{1}{2}$, in other words $P(I) = \frac{1}{2}$, because we can either be called or not. 
 Then, the probability of getting the job (lets call this event $J$) strictly depends on event $I$, because, for example, you cannot get the job, if you don't first go to the interview. 
 What we actually want to know is the probability of being called and getting the job, in other words we want to know $P(I \text{ and } J)$. Since these events are dependent, we can use the rule that $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \cdot P(B | A)$, where $P(B|A)$ is the probability of event $B$ happens given the fact that event $A$ has happened.  
 Applying this rule to my case, I need to find $P(J | I)$, because I already know $P(I) = \frac{1}{2}$. I was thinking that this probability is $\frac{1}{4}$. Why? Basically, from $\frac{1}{2}$ of the possibilities remaining we have half of the chances to get the job, so $\frac{1}{2}$ of $\frac{1}{2}$ is $\frac{1}{4}$. 
 I can now calculate $P(I \text{ and } J)$, which should be $P(I) \cdot P(J | I) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8}$.  
 If my reasonings are correct, this should represent the probability of getting job from one place. 
Since I am applying for three different jobs (which are not dependent between each other), then I have more possibilities than $\frac{1}{8}$, so I thought we could sum the possibilities of getting a job for each individual place, thus my answer would be $\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}$.

Where  $C$  is the semi-circle of radius  $R$  in the upper half plane parameterized counter-clockwise. As  $R\to\infty$ , the semi-circular integral vanishes, and a symmetry argument shows that  $I_1=I_2/2$ .

"I have to calculate  $$\lim_{x\to 0} {1\over x} \int_0^x \cos(t^2)\,dt$$ 
 My intuition is that the answer is 1 because as  $x$  becomes very small,  $x^2$  also becomes very small and I am tempted to write  $$\lim_{x\to 0} \int_0^x \cos(t^2)\,dt=\lim_{x\to 0} \int_0^x \cos(t)\,dt$$ 
 And then, because  $(\sin x)'=\cos x$ ,
we have  $$\lim_{x\to 0} {1\over x} \int_0^x \cos(t^2) \, dt = \lim_{x\to 0} {1\over x} \int_0^x \cos(t) \, dt=\lim_{x\to 0} {1\over x} (\sin x -\sin 0)=\lim_{x\to 0} {\sin x\over x}= 1$$

"I have been bugged by a simple problem in statistics recently. Let's assume that I have made a set of measurements of a certain quantity, each with an uncertainty estimate. I have a set of tuples $\{x_i,s_i\}$ ($x$ is a value, $s$ its uncertainty). 
 The goal is to calculate the most likely true value $y$ and its uncertainty $S$. 
 My solution: 
I assume that each measurement $x_i$ follows a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation $s_i$, meaning that the probability that $y$ is the true value provided $x_i$ is
$$
P(y|x_i,s_i) \propto \exp \left ( -\frac{(x_i-y)^2}{2s_i^2} \right ) \,.
$$
Therefore the total probability (the measurements are independent) that $y$ is the true value should be
$$
P(y|\{x_i,s_i\}) \propto \exp \left ( -\sum_i \frac{(x_i-y)^2}{2s_i^2} \right ) \,.
$$
Searching for the most probable $y$, I just set $\partial P / \partial y = 0$. I then get
$$
\sum_i \frac{y}{s_i^2} = \sum_i \frac{x_i}{s_i^2} \, .
$$
Therefore the most probable value should just be an average measurements, using the squares of reciprocals of their uncertainties as weights. So far so good. 
 I would then like to know that the standard deviation (its estimate) in $y$ is. I therefore look at $P(y+a|\{x_i,s_i\})/P(y|\{x_i,s_i\})$ (for some $a$). 
 What I get is
$$
\frac{P(y+a)}{P(y)} = \exp \left ( - \sum_i \frac{a^2}{2s_i^2} \right ) \, ,
$$
therefore the standard deviation should be
$$
\frac{1}{S^2} = \sum_i \frac{1}{s_i^2} \, .
$$ 
 That all makes sense. Provided that all the errors are the same, then $S = s/\sqrt{N}$.  However, if I set all errors to 0 ($s_i = 0$), then the $S$ is also be 0.  But there is still some uncertainty due to the  spread of values $\{x_i\}$. 
 My question is:  How should I approach the problem in order to incorporate both the spread of $\{x_i\}$ and their uncertainties $\{s_i\}$ in the total uncertainty $S$? 
 Thanks a lot.

"I'm trying to figure out a formula to create a rounded rectangle... but I need to do it by finding the distance from $(0, 0)$ to the line/edge of the rectangle given the angle provided as a vector. 
 Ok.. so here is the formula to plot the rectangle:  $\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^n + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^n = 1$ 
 In my usage a and b will both be 1. Thus the formula can be simplified into $x^n + y^n = 1$ 
 http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x%5E4+%2B+y%5E4+%3D+1 
 
 My input will be a point in space that can represent a vector.  Say it's (.5,.5).  The angle of this vector is $45^\circ$ and therefore it intersects with the plotted line at a specific distance from $(0, 0)$.  I don't need to know the $x$, $y$ of the plot per se.  I need to know the distance to that point.  If I have the x,y I can easily calculate the distance.  But maybe there is a way to calculate the distance directly. 
 I know I have: $\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^n + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^n = 1$ 
 and I have $d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ 
 But alone that isn't enough info for me to figure it out.  I can see a pattern in there though.  OH crap they're the same formula, except that $n=2$, where I want $n=4$ (or $n>4$).  When $d = 1$ the square root of $1 = 1$. 
 I was able to solve for d like this - but I don't know if this is helping... 
 
 1 = x^n + y^n 
 0 = x^n + y^n - 1 
 d = sqr(x^2 + y^2) 
 0 = sqr(x^2 + y^2) - d 
 d = 1 + sqr(x^2 + y^2) - x^n - y^n 
 
 But still.. I don't know x and y on the plot.  I'm given x,y in space and have to find the distance to the plotted line where it intersects with that vector. 
 Maybe rather I need some sort of intersection type formula??  Any ideas? 
 EDIT ---- 
 Really what I need is to figure out the distance to the line at any given angle. 
 EDIT 2 -- 
 What about this approach.. 
 Here are the knowns.. I have an x,y out in space.  Therefore I have an angle and a distance for that vector.  I also know the base size of the rounded rectangle. 
 If it was a circle it's easy cause the radius of a circle is constant. 
 
 My answer here might not be very mathematical in terms of equation syntax.. but I'm a programmer, not a mathematician..  
 It should be possible to calculate the difference between the radius of the circle (known if the object were a circle) and the ""radius"" at any point on the rounded rectangle. 
 At an angle of $\theta$ they are the same.  At and angle of 90 they are the same.  But at points between the two they are not. 
 If the radius of the circle is 1.. then you have $d = 1 + \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - x^n - y^n$ for the ""radius"" or distance to the edge of the rounded rectangle. 
 The difference between the two is delta $d = 1 - x^n - y^n$ 
 So if our desired rectangle is S in size instead of 1 - S is a scale factor over the 1. 
 If I normalize the vector $(x, y)$ and make it's length 1.  Then use that x, y to figure out the delta d. I can then scale that dd by S and add it to d to get the distance at that angle.

 A buggy is set to cross over a snowy terrain. The driver seat has a
rectangular window featured in the diagram from below. When the driver
activates the mechanism for cleaning the window from the snow, the
wiper spins  $120^{\circ}$  using the point  $M$  as a pivot. Assuming the
rotation is clockwise. Find the area covered by the windshield wiper
in the buggy. Assume the wiper has a T shape and the rectangular
window is  $ABCD$  where  $BC=2AB=2AE=2AM=1\,m$ . Also assume AE is
perpendicular to  $MN$  and  $N$  is midpoint between  $AE$ .

 $A=\frac{\alpha}{360}\pi r^2$ 
 Assuming  $\alpha$  is an angle given in sexagesimal units. But in this case the figure doesn't help much. How exactly should I find that weird surface. 
 Can someone help me with a method relying euclidean geometry or something along precalculus?. I think integrals can be used but I am not looking for such sort of answer. 
 Please include a drawing in the answer  because for me it is not easy to spot how to find such problematic area. Does it require some sort of construction?.

"For a project, I'm working on calculating solid angles using calculus, but when I test my formula for the solid angle of a regular tetrahedron, I end up with $0.4633$ when according to Wolfram, I should get $0.5513$. This is going to be a bit long... 
 The solid angle is equal to the spanned area ($\Omega$) on the unit sphere. We also know that the area spanned is directly proportional to the volume spanned ($V$) by the solid angle. 
 $$\frac{\Omega}{4\pi}=\frac{V}{4\pi/3}\to\Omega=\frac{V\times4\pi}{4\pi/3}\to\Omega=3V$$ 
 And $V$ can be found through some integration. I will be integrating the region using spherical coordinates, but honestly I don't like how $\phi$ is defined as the angle with respect to the $Z$-axis. Instead I will have $\phi$ be the angle with respect to the $XY$-plane (like angle of elevation). This puts $\phi$ inside the solid angle as opposed to outside of it. So to convert from Cartesian coordinates to this new coordinate system. 
 $$(x,y,z)=(\rho\cos\theta\cos\phi,\rho\sin\theta\cos\phi,\rho\sin\phi)$$
$$\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(\rho,\theta,\phi)}=\begin{vmatrix}\cos\theta\cos\phi&-\rho\sin\theta\cos\phi&-\rho\cos\theta\sin\phi\\\sin\theta\cos\phi&\rho\cos\theta\cos\phi&-\rho\sin\theta\sin\phi\\\sin\phi&0&\rho\cos\phi\end{vmatrix}=\rho^2\cos\phi$$ 
 And so our solid angle can be calculated as 
 $$\Omega=3V=3\iiint_V\rho^2\cos\phi\ d\rho\ d\theta\ d\phi$$ 
 Since we will always be using a unit sphere 
 $$\Omega=3\iint_A\int_0^1\rho^2\cos\phi\ d\rho\ d\theta\ d\phi=\iint_A\cos\phi\ d\theta\ d\phi$$ 
 Now to calculate the solid angle formed by three vectors $u$, $v$, and $w$. First we orient the solid angle into a standard position so that $u$ points in the direction $(1, 0, 0)$, $v$ lies on the plane $(\rho, \theta, 0)$, and $w$ lies anywhere in $(\rho,\theta,\phi)$. Let $\alpha$ be the angle between $u$ and $v$ (azimuth of the solid angle), and let $\beta$ be the angle between $w$ and the plane $(\rho,\theta,0)$ (elevation of the solid angle). For simplicity, we assume $0\le\alpha,\beta\le\pi/2$. The region of integration can be represented as 
 
 Where $\alpha_1+\alpha_2=\alpha$. Thus 
 $$\begin{align}\Omega&=\int_0^\beta\int_{\alpha_1\phi/\beta}^{-\alpha_2\phi/\beta+\alpha}\cos\phi\ d\theta\ d\phi\\&=\int_0^\beta\cos\phi\left(-\frac{\alpha_2}{\beta}\phi+\alpha-\frac{\alpha_1}{\beta}\phi\right)d\phi\\&=\int_0^\beta\cos\phi\left(-\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\phi+\alpha\right)d\phi\\&=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\left(1-\cos\beta\right)\end{align}$$ 
 For a regular tetrahedron $\alpha=\pi/3,\beta=\cos^{-1}(\sqrt3/3)$. However, my equation returns $0.4633$ steradians. 
 I have no idea where I went wrong.

now, finding the first and second moment wasn't too hard.

The second derivative is awful enough, so finding the third involves some really ugly expression. No matter how much I tried, I just couldn't find this third derivative.

But I am not able to figure out what type of random variable $X$ is. In my understanding, $X$ cannot be continuous since $\mathbb{P}(X=0)=1/2\neq 0$, and $X$ cannot be discrete either since the range of $X$ is uncountable. How do I calculate $\mathbb{E}[X]$?

 2013 10C.  Question:  Consider the bounded surface S that is the union of $x^2 + y^2 = 4$ for $−2 \le z \le 2$
  and $(4 − z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 $ for $2 \le z \le 4.$  Sketch  the surface.
  Use suitable parametrisations for the two parts of S to verify Stokes’s Theorem for 
  $\mathbf{F} = (yz^2,0,0)$. 
 
 Herein, I'm asking only about proof strategy for  Without Stokes's Theorem - Calculate $\iint_S \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F} \cdot\; d\mathbf{S}$ for $\mathbf{F} = yz^2\mathbf{i}$ - 2013 10C , so omit irrelative calculations here. As I do there, denote the $2 \le z \le 4$ cone P, and the $-2 \le z \le 2$ cylinder C.  
 User ellya's solution:  $\bbox[3px,border:2px solid gray]{ \text{ 1st, do surface integral over cylinder  C} }$ Parameterize from the start. 
So let  $x=2\cos\phi \text{ and } y=2\sin\phi $,  where $ 0\le\phi\le 2\pi $ and $-2 \le z \le 2$.  
 Now parameterise our surface $C$ as $\mathbf{r} (\phi,z)=(2\cos\phi,2\sin\phi,z) \implies \mathbf{ F \, (r} (\phi,z) \, ) =(2z^2\sin\phi,0,0)$. 
 
 $1.$ Why parameterise with $x = ...\cos\theta, y = ...\sin\theta$?
  Why not reverse them, say $y = ...\cos\theta, x = ...\sin\theta$? Would this still function? 
 
 With this orientation, the normal $\mathbf{n} =\mathbf{r}_{\phi}\times \mathbf{r}_z   =(2\cos\phi,2\sin\phi,0)$ 
 
 $2.$ How would one determine that it's $\color{green}{(\partial_{\phi} \mathbf{r} \times \partial_{z} \mathbf{r}} )$ that 'produces the outward normal which is what we want', and not $\color{darkred}{(\partial_{z} \mathbf{r}  \times \partial_{\phi} \mathbf{r} )}$, for BOTH pieces C & P? 
  I'm aware that everything must be positively oriented by convention. 
  I'm not enquiring about a geometric or visual answer.

yz^2 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right|=(0,\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(yz^2),-z^2)=(0,2yz,-z^2) \quad \color{orangered}{ (*) }$ 
 Substitute the parametrisation for C into $\color{orangered}{ (*) } : curl F   =(0,4z\sin\phi,-z^2)$. 
 So $\iint_C(\nabla\times \mathbf{F})\cdot d\mathbf{S}  = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{-2}^2(0,4z\sin\phi,-z^2)\cdot(2\cos\phi,2\sin\phi,0) \,dz ~ d\phi    = ...$ 
 $\bbox[3px,border:2px solid gray]{ \text{ 2nd and last, compute for cone $P$. } }$ 
 The question hypothesises $4 - z = $ radius of the cone, so $z = 4 - r$. The cross-section of any cone is just a circle with radius $z$. So parameterise  with 
$\mathbf{r} (\phi,z)=((4-z)\cos\phi,(4-z)\sin\phi,4-r)$ where $ 0\le\phi\le 2\pi $ and $2 \le z \le 4$. 
 Substitute the parametrisation for P into $\color{orangered}{ (*) } : curl F   =(0,2z(4-z)\sin\phi,-z^2)$. 
 $\mathbf{n} =\mathbf{r}_{\phi}\times \mathbf{r}_z = ((4-z)\cos\phi,(4-z)\sin\phi,4-z)$

"For any mathematical average, the sum of how much larger than the average the numbers above are must equal the sum of how much smaller than the average the numbers below are. 
 Mathematical averages are usually calculated by adding all the numbers up and dividing the sum by how many numbers there are. The mathematical average of a group of numbers indicates the number overall the overall group is closest to. 
 Now an example of the theorem:
For example, if the numbers are  $75$  and  $79$ , the average is  $77$  because  $79$  is 2 larger than  $77$  and  $75$  is 2 smaller than  $77$ . This is common sense. 
 But what if you have 3 numbers? Let's say you have  $74$ ,  $78$ , and  $79$ . The average is  $77$  because  $78$  is 1 larger than  $77$  and  $79$  is 2 larger than  $77$  and 2 + 1 = 3.  $74$  is 3 smaller than  $77$  so 3=3. You can use guess and check until you arrive at the average if you're not sure which number to pick. 
 This method can help you calculate means of numbers that are close together faster in your head without adding up the numbers or the one's digits of the numbers. It will work on any mean. 
 Derivation of the theorem:
 $N_1 - y + N_3 - y +… = y - N_2 + y - N_4 +… $ 
 $N_1 + N_3 + N_2 + N_4 + N… = 4y + … +y$ 
 Sorry, I didn’t use the correct notation here, but one can see you will have all the extra  $N_5$ ’s,  $N_6$ ’s, and so on on the left side and the corresponding number of additional  $y$ ’s on the right side.

"The entropy (self information) of a  discrete  random variable X is calculated as: 
 $$
H(x)=E(-\log[P(X)])
$$ 
 What does the  $-\log[P(X)]$  mean? It seems to be something like """" the self information of each possible outcome of the random variable X "". 
 And why do we use  log  function to calculate it? 
 ADD 1 
 Well, below is my reasoning: 
 The root motivation is to quantify/measure the uncertainty contained in a random variable. 
 Intuitively , people tend to agree that there's  some connection between uncertainty and probability . And still  intuitively , people shall agree that: 
 
 the more probability an outcome has, the less uncertainty it has. 
 thus , the less probability an outcome has, the more uncertainty it has. 
 
 So, I think if we want to measure the uncertainty for an outcome of a random variable, the measure function should satisfy: 
 
 the value of uncertainty measure should be positive ( human instinct when counting ) 
 the value of this measure for the uncertainty of an outcome should be monotonic decreasing function of the probability of that outcome. 
 for outcomes of independent experiments, the uncertainty should be additive. That is for P(A)*P(B), the total uncertainty should be the sum of A's and B's. ( This is kind of instinctive, too. ) 
 
 Then I come to the choice of -log[p(i)] as the measure of uncertainty  of each possible outcome , or self-information of each outcome. 
 Then I treat the entropy as the weighted average of the self-information of all possible outcomes. 
 I just read the book < Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms > by MacKay. The author indeed gives a similar explanation to mine. And he name it the  information content of each outcome . It is not difficult to see that  entropy better describes a random variable than the information content . 
 And it is  coincidental  that the formula we  intuitively  found to measure the average information content of a random variable has  a similar form to the one of entropy in thermodynamics . Thus comes the name  information entropy ... 
 BTW I want to quote some words from Einstein... 
 
 ""It is not so important where one settles down. The best thing is to
follow your instincts without too much reflection.""

 ADD 2 
 Following my above reasoning, I tried to derive the calculation of entropy for a  continuous  random variable Y in a  similar  way.  But I was blocked . Details below. 
 Let Y's p.d.f be:  $$f(y)$$ 
 Then, if we  strictly  follow my previous reasoning, then we should pick up a small interval of  I , and the  probability  of Y within interval I is given by:  $$P(y\ within\ I)=\int_If(y)dy$$ Then the measure of uncertainty for Y to fall in interval I should be:  $$m(y\ within\ I) = -log\int_If(y)dy$$  Then, to get the entropy, we should get the expectation/average of  this measure m , which is essentially:  $$E[m(y\ within\ I)]$$  and it can be expanded as below: 
 $$
\int{P(y\ within\ I)*m(y\ within\ I)}dI
=\int{(\int_I{f(y)dy}*{(-log\int_If(y)dy)})dI}
$$ 
 I found myself stuck here because the interval I is not strictly defined. 
 Then I find from  here  the authoritative definition of entropy of continuous random variable: 
 $$
H(Y)=-\int{f(y)log[f(y)]dy}
$$ 
 The p.d.f.  $f(y)$  can certainly be  $> 1$ , so the  $H(Y)$  can be  negative , while in discrete scenario, the  $H(X)$  is always  non-negative . 
 I cannot explain the why this in-consistence is happening. For now, I can only consider it as a  philosophical difficulty regarding continuity and discreteness . 
 Some of my personal feeling (can be safely ignored): 
 
 In the discrete scenario, the  concrete countable  outcome provide the
 foothold  for us to carry out our calculation. But in the continuous
scenario, there's no such ready-made foothold (unless we can somehow
make one). Without such foothold, it feels like we just keep falling
into the endless hollowness of mind. 
 
 Anyone could shed some light?

 After years of observations it has been found out that if it rains on
given day, there is a 60% chance that it will rain on the next day
too. If it is not raining, the chance of rain on the next day is only
25%. The weather forecast for Friday predicts the chance of rain is
75%. What is the probability that at least one day of the weekend will
have no rain? 
 
 I calculate the probability that at least one day of the weekend will have no rain as
 $$P(\overline{Saturday} \cup  \overline{Sunday}) = 1 - P(Saturday \cap  Sunday) = 1 - P(Saturday)*P(Sunday)$$ 
where  $P(Saturday)$  and  $P(Sunday)$  are the probabilities of raining on Saturday and Sunday respectively. 
 I compute the probability of raining on Saturday by adding the likelihoods of two exclusive events: raining on Saturday after raining on Friday and raining on Saturday after not raining on Friday. 
 $$P(Saturday)=P(Saturday \cap Friday)+P(Saturday \cap \overline{Friday}) =P(Saturday|Friday)*P(Friday)+P(Saturday|\overline{Friday})*P(\overline{Friday})=0.6*0.75+0.25*(1-0.75)=0.5125$$ 
 Similarly, I compute the probability of raining on Sunday:
 $$P(Sunday)=P(Sunday \cap Saturday)+P(Sunday \cap \overline{Saturday})=P(Sunday|Saturday)*P(Saturday)+P(Sunday|\overline{Saturday})*P(\overline{Saturday})=0.6*0.5125+0.25*(1-0.5125)=0.429375$$ 
 Now I can find the result:
 $$P(\overline{Saturday} \cup  \overline{Sunday}) = 1 - P(Saturday)*P(Sunday)=1-0.5125*0.429375=0.7799453125$$

 I have no background whatsoever in number theory, and I need to find software that can calculate the order of $b \mod p$, where $b = 2^{32}$ and $p$ is of the form $p = a * b^r + 1$.  I've calculated a number of suitable primes using NewPGen and PFGW (as well as Proth.exe), but I have no obvious way of calculating the order of $b \mod p$. 
 Does anyone know of any program that can do this? 
 Context, if needed: 
 I read here ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5760639/complimentary-multiply-with-carry-period/8781297#8781297 ) that calculating the order requires factoring $\phi(p) = p - 1$.  Then, for every factor $k$, the order of $b \mod p$ is the smallest $k$ such that $b^{(\phi(p)/k)}\mod p = 1$. 
 Factoring $p - 1$ is easy in my case, since all of my candidates are already factored for the most part (except the $a$ term), but from what I understand I need not only the prime factors but ALL factors of $p - 1$, and it seems there will always be a ton of them when $b$ is a large power of $2$.  (I don't understand all of that post though, such as their calculation of the number of factors the original poster would have to test.) 
 Unfortunately, I'm dealing with relatively large numbers here, e.g. $p = 131071 * 2^{864} + 1$.  In this example $a = 131071$ is mercifully prime, but there are $864$ different $2$ factors.  Naively trying every possible combination of the $865$ prime factors would presumably require calculating $b^{phi(p)/k}\mod p$ for, uh...$\sum_{i=1}^{865} 865!/(i!(865 - i)!)$ different $k$'s, which is more than anyone could calculate in the lifetime of the universe. 
 Knowing $864$ of $phi(p) = p - 1$'s factors are all $2$'s makes things much more manageable, and we only need to try I think $1730$ different $k$'s ($1$ or $131072$ times anywhere from $0$ to $864$ factors of $2$).  If this post is anything to go by, I MIGHT be able to get away with testing only $k$'s containing all $864$ $2$ factors, but I could easily be wrong, since the presence of a non-$2$ factor might change things:   Why 4 is not a primitive root modulo p for any prime p? . 
 I don't know modular arithmetic though, so even if I only had to test a handful of $k$'s to obtain the order, there's no obvious way for me to calculate something as huge as $b^{(\phi(p)/k)}\mod p$ even once, when $b = 2^{32}$.  The numbers are just too big...so I need some software that knows how to do this sort of thing, preferably software that can calculate the order of $b \mod p$ straight out of the box. 
 I've found a program that claims to be able to do this, but even the smallest and most trivial prime I'm interested in ($p = 255 * 2^{32} + 1$) is too big for it to handle:
 http://www.softpedia.com/get/Science-CAD/ORDER-OF-A-MODULO-P.shtml 
 Additional Context: 
 I'm trying to find suitable parameters for complementary multiply with carry (CMWC) generators, a class of random number generators invented by George Marsaglia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply_with_Carry ).  These generators require a prime of the form $p = a * b^r + 1$, where $a$ is some multiplier, $b$ is the base, and $r$ is the lag of the generator (which increases the period).  The period of a CMWC generator is the order of $b \mod p$, and I'm trying to calculate the period of generators fitting the following description: 
 
 $b = 2^{32}$, which allows the generator to natively return the full range of unsigned 32-bit numbers, without incurring the cost of a remapping output function. 
 $r$ is in $[1, 32]$, with special emphasis on $r = 4, 8, 16, 32$.  $r$ controls the maximum possible period of the generator, but it also controls the amount of state that needs to be stored, and I'm looking for lightweight generators that come as close as possible to maximal period.  (Marsaglia calculated suitable parameters for smaller base-$2^{32} - 1$ CMWC generators, and he also provided parameters for smaller base-$2^{32}$ MWC generators...but the only base-$2^{32}$ CMWC generator he talked about was CMWC4827, with $r = 4827$...which is too large for my purposes.) 
 $a$ can be anything, but things can be a bit more efficient if $a = 2^n \pm 1$.  I have a few candidate $a$'s that fit this description, but not for my preferred power-of-2 $r$ candidates, unfortunately.

 Calculate  $$E(Ω)=\int_1^2{\ln x \over x}{dx}$$ 
 $E$  derives from the greek word ""εμβαδόν"" which in English means area.  $Ω$  is the specific ""area"" that is being calculated by the integral. 
 
 Personal work: 
 $$E(Ω)=\int_1^2{\ln x \over x}{dx}= \int_1^2{\ln x {1\over x}}{dx}=\int_1^2{\ln x (|\ln x|)'}{dx}=[\ln x|\ln x|]_1^2-\int_1^2(\ln x)'|\ln x|dx=\cdots=\ln4-\int_1^2 {1\over x}|\ln x|\,dx$$

"So I'm familiar with the simple methods of calculating the Hausdorff dimension of a fractal, but when I try to apply them for this case I get into trouble. What I mean with the simple method is using the scaling factor and the amount of repetitions to exactly calculate the Hausdorff dimension. 
 The fractal below is constructed by taking all horizontal line segments, dividing each into three equally long line segments, raise the one in the middle by it's own length and connecting it to its former neighbors with two vertical line segments. 
 
 If I decided during my construction steps not to add those vertical lines, it would be clear that the whole fractal would be 1-dimensional. Each vertical line segment is 1-dimensional as well. But if I were to assume that the whole fractal was 1-dimensional, then it would be of infinite length. 
 There are more cases of fractals I can think of where I run into the same questions. For example a fractal where each point has position (1/2) i  on the line interval [0,1] for all i in ℕ. Would this be a 0-dimensional fractal of infinite size?

"Foreword, I have a stronger background in philosophy than mathematics, but I am interested in linking the two topics. 
So I excuse in advance if this question feel silly;
Also please delete/close it if this doesn't fit the site policy. 
 For example, considering only one variable to calculate the probability of the birth of a person: 
 
 the probability of one particuliar spermatozoon to penetrate the ovum. 
 
 As there is about 250 millions spermatazoons per ejaculation, that give roughly 1 chance on 250 millions that a particular spermatozoon reaches the egg. 
Taking the last 2000 years and considering a generation is about 20 years,
the probability one person is born considering only the spermatozoons variable is: 
 250 000 000^100 
 So that means if we are standing at year 0, there is 1 chance on 6.22E+839 that a particuliar human, like you or me, is born 2000 years later (and this only taking one variable and a small generation number in consideration). 
 So probability speaking, this event is very unlikely to happen, but it happened for every human on the planet. 
Looking only at the numbers, it feel paradoxal that a such low probability is happening with a 100% chance.  
 It might be ""cheating"" to take a event and calculate the probabilities of causes that might have led to this result,
anyway I would like to get mathematicians views on this paradox. 
 Sidenotes: 
To put the question in more theoric terms, probability implies non-determinism, but causality imply determinism. 
The law of physics suggesting causality of the world at some extend (skipping quantum physics here), a non determistic approach (probabilistic) of a determinist system can lead to paradoxal results, eg every living human on earth has a lower probability than 1 on 6.22E+839 to be born as he/she is. 
 ps: If considering the world including future events to be deterministic is problematic, we can admit that the past, as being finished and generated only one present outcome, as a deterministic system.

 I wish to calculate the integral

 $$z^4-z=z(z-1)(z-e^{2i\pi/3})(z-e^{-2i\pi/3})$$
We must make branch cuts which go through the branch points. The branch points of $\sqrt{z^4-z}$ are $z=0,1,e^{2i\pi/3},e^{-2i\pi/3}$. All of these lie inside this contour, so I first thought that I must work out the residue at each of these points, and then use the residue theorem. However there is no nice way that I could think of to calculate these residues.  
 Then it occurred to me that I am not even sure if they exist - these are not poles, they are branch points with branch cuts through them. I then saw that the question has a hint saying to use Laurent Series. Most of the Laurent series I have ever seen have been functions with (sort of) Taylor series, but with some change of variables, or multiplied by some factor of $1/z^n$. The point is - I don't know any (efficient) way of finding the Laurent Series for this function. 
 
 My questions : How can I 
 
 Define these branch cuts, 
 Find the different Laurent Series, and find the value of the coefficient of $1/z$, thus finding value of the integral? 
 
 Also: 
 
 I thought Laurent Series existed within an annulus of the point about which they exist - how is this possible for a function with branch cuts? Is there something I am confusing here? These two ideas I had seem to contradict. 
 If the Laurent Series do exist, then is it possible to calculate the residues directly? (Also assuming these exist)

 For this particular problem we confine our attention to the bottom-right partition where both balls are red. There are $N(R) = 7\times 7 = 49$ such balls, and since there are $N(\Omega) = 10 \times 10 = 100$ possible events, the probability should be: 
 $$P(R) = {N(R) \over N(\Omega)} = {49 \over 100}. \tag{My Answer}$$ 
 The book, however, calculates another number, using the formula $C_n^r = {n! \over r! \cdot (n-r)!}$: 
 $$C_{10}^2 = {10! \over 2! \cdot 8!} = 45,$$ 
 $$C_{7}^2 = {7! \over 2! \cdot 5!} = 21,$$ 
 $$P(R) = {C_{7}^2 \over C_{10}^2} = {7 \over 15}. \tag{The Answer}$$ 
 I haven't studied permutations and combinations to any degree of satisfaction, so I don't get the intuition behind this approach. I don't doubt of course that $C_{10}^2$ is 45. I'm just not sure what that corresponds to on the table I've made. Maybe the table is completely useless? My questions are: 
 
 Question 1.  What's wrong with my approach? (Why am I getting 49 instead of 45?)  
 Question 2.  What's the intuition behind the use of the combinations formula here?  
 
 This second question may be too broad for this format, so please ignore it if that's the case. I'd appreciate any comments/answers to either of the questions.

"Question: 
 $$\int_0^{4\pi}\frac{dx}{5+4\cos x} $$ 
 My approach:   
 First I calculated the antiderivative as follows:   
 Using:  $\cos\theta= \frac{1-\tan^2\frac{\theta}{2}}{1+\tan^2\frac{\theta}{2}}$  we have: 
 $\int\frac{dx}{5+4\cos x}=\int\frac{dx}{5+4\frac{1-\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}{1+\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}}=\int\frac{1+\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}{5+5\tan^2\frac{x}{2}+4-4\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}dx=\int\frac{\frac{1}{\cos^2 \frac{x}{2}}}{3^2+\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}dx$ 
 Using substitution we have:   
 $u=\tan\frac{x}{2}$ 
 $du=\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{\cos^2\frac{x}{2}}dx$   
 $2\int\frac{\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{\cos^2 \frac{x}{2}}}{3^2+\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}dx=2\int\frac{du}{3^2+u^2}=\frac{2}{3}\arctan\frac{u}{3}+\mathscr{C}=\frac{2}{3}\arctan\frac{\tan\frac{x}{2}}{3}+ \mathscr{C}$ 
 Now we can calculate the definite integral as follows:   
 $\int_0^{4\pi}\frac{dx}{5+4\cos x} = \frac{2}{3}\arctan\frac{\tan\frac{x}{2}}{3}\bigl|_0^{4\pi}=\frac{2}{3}(\arctan\frac{\tan\frac{4\pi}{2}}{3}-\arctan\frac{\tan\frac{0}{2}}{3})=0$   
 The result I get is  $0$  but the correct one is  $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ .  Can someone explain me why?   
 Here it shows that the correct answer is  $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ .

"I know that if n is odd there are no possible walks.  
 If n is even, I pick 2 random opposite vertices, a and b.
From ""a"" there are only 2 types of ""movements"" I can do in the graph, clockwise (call it ""x"") or anti-clockwise (call it ""y"").  
 If i want to go from ""a"" to ""b"" (random opposite vertices in the graph) in n steps I need to do a permutation of the movements x and y, and i know that the sum of the amount of movements ""x"" and the movements ""y"" is n. 
 Now, if i do an ""x"" movement and a ""y"" movement they cancel each other. So assigning the integer 1 to every ""x"" movement and the integer -1 to every ""y"" movement, I know that the sum of all the ""1""'s and ""-1""'s of a set of n movements x and y is going to be equal to either 2 or -2 because the distance between 2 opposite vertices is 2 (in this particular graph). 
 I'm going to call |x| and |y| to the amount of x's and y's in a set of movements. |x| + |y| = n, and |x|-|y|= 2 or -2. 
 So I have 2 cases;  
 a). |x| = (n+2)/2 & |y| = (n-2)/2 
 b). |y| = (n+2)/2 & |x| = (n-2)/2 
 I want calculate the amount of permutation of n elements of 2 types ""x"" and ""y"".

 A company of total value $v$ is distributed amongst 5 people (I refer to their ownership amounts as $x$,$k$,$e$,$m$,$d$ and $s$) according to the following percentages (shares) of the total amount value $v$:

 $k_0=\frac{4}{13}v$ 
 $e_0=\frac{2}{13}v$ 
 $m_0=\frac{2}{13}v$ 
 $s_0=\frac{1}{13}v$ 
 Person $x$ decided to leave the company and asked that his share to be distributed amongst the remaining people plus 1 new person $d$. The distribution rule is such that person $s$ would take half of ANY of the persons $k$ or $e$ or $m$ or $d$. 
 The question: 
 For each person involved, find the share (percentage of the total amount) under the above mentioned rules. 
 Note: This is a real-life problem and not a homework - There are no word tricks here or puzzles. Your verification or correction is very much appreciated. Also, if you have a simpler approach, it would be appreciated. Please explain each step clearly if you would, so that I can understand - Thx. 
 My answer: 
 Step1: Calculate each individual share of x's share as follows: 
 share for x will be distributed as: 
 $x_0=k+e+m++d+s$ 
 given that $k=e=m=d$ and that $s=0.5k$ 
 $x_0=4k+0.5k$ 
 $k=\frac{2x_0}{9}$ 
 Since x's share was $x_0=\frac{4}{13}v$ 
 $k=\frac {2}{9} * \frac{4v}{13}$ 
 $k=\frac {8v}{13*9}$ 
 $k=\frac {8v}{117}$ and the same value applies to $m$,$e$,$d$ ----- (EQ 1) 
 $s=\frac {4}{13} * \frac{v}{9}=\frac{4v}{117}$ 
 Step 2: Calculate each individual absolute (final) share value: 
 $x's shares are to introduced individually and person d's shares to be calculated. 
 $k=\frac{4v}{13} + \frac {8v}{117} = \frac{572v}{1521}$ 
 $e=\frac{2v}{13} + \frac {8v}{117} = \frac{338v}{1521}$ 
 $m=\frac{2v}{13} + \frac {8v}{117} =\frac{338v}{1521}$ 
 $s=\frac{v}{13} + \frac{4v}{117} = \frac{169v}{1521}$ 
 The share for $d$ would be calculated as: total percentage value ($v$) - sum of all share percentages above. 
 $d =  1-(\frac{572v}{1521} + \frac{338v}{1521} + \frac{338v}{1521}+\frac{169v}{1521})$ 
 $d=\frac{104v}{1521}$ 
 Same result for $d$ could be obtained from (EQ 1):
$d=\frac {8v}{117}$

 I have corrected the statement and renamed initial shares with sub zero to  have more accurate formulation.

 If there is initial guess of uN and gN, why can't we just use matlab's fourier fit for example:  
 fit(t, u,'fourier3') 
 Similarly for gN too? I have no idea about where IFFT be done!

"I have been thinking of a problem that I cannot solve by myself. I would really appretiate any help. Let's assume I am studying a bus line in one (and only one) direction, with  $n$  stops numbered 1 to 4 (for example): 
     1      2      3      4
    o ---> o ---> o ---> o
 
 I could represent the trips on the bus line as a matrix: 
 $$
\begin{matrix}
 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
1 & 0 & t_{12} & t_{13} & t_{14} \\
2 & 0 & 0 & t_{23} & t_{24} \\
3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & t_{34} \\
4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{matrix}
$$ 
 Since the bus line is one direction only, no one can go in the oposite direction, and it doesn't make sense to board and alight on the same stop, so the diagonal and the bottom triangle should all be 0. There can be any number of trips:  $t_{12}$  is any natural number ( $\mathbb{N}$ ). It doesn't make sense to have a negative, fractional or real number of trips. 
 I can calculate the total number of boardings and alightings at each stop, as they are just the rows and columns totals (respectively): 
 $$ Boardings_i = \sum_{j=1}^4 t_{ij}$$ 
 $$ Alightings_i = \sum_{i=1}^4 t_{ij}$$ 
 Everyone getting on the bus should get down at some point, so total boardings must equal total alightings: 
 $$ \sum_{i=1}^4 B_i = \sum_{i=1}^4 A_i $$ 
 Now, let's assume I know this totals for rows and columns (the number of people boarding and alighting on each stop),  $(B_i, A_i) \in \mathbb{N}$  , and I want to find a matrix ( $t_{ij}$ ) that produces these totals.  How many matrices are there that add up to these row and column totals? 
 I have tried to develop an intuition for this. I know the solution is trivial for  $n = 2$ , and there is one and only one solution for  $n = 3$ , as I can express the problem as a system of linear equations: 
 \begin{align}
B_1 & = t_{12} + t_{13} \\
B_2 & = t_{23} \\
A_2 & = t_{12} \\
A_3 & = t_{13} + t_{23} \\
B_1 + B_2 & = A_2 + A_3 \\
\end{align} 
 I am stuck there. I know for  $n = 4$  the number of possible solutions depend on the total number of trips. For higher values of  $(B_i, A_i)$ , I should expect a higher number of solutions possible. Except the matrix structure counts: there is only one valid solution for  $B_i = [x, x, x, 0], A_i=[0, x, x, x]$ , regardless of the value of x. Specifically, high values in the right-top matrix cells  $(t_{13}, t_{14}, t_{24})$  seem produce higher number of possible solutions (degrees of freedom?),  $t_{12}$  and  $t_{34}$  seem to reduce the number of posible solutions, while other matrix cells next to the diagonal (e.g.  $t_{23}$ ) seem to provide no information / have no effect because their values are determined from other matrix cells. For example: 
 
 $B_i = [8, 4, 2, 0], A_i=[0, 0, 6, 8]$  allows for 5 different matrices resulting in the given row and column totals 
 $B_i = [8, 5, 1, 0], A_i=[0, 0, 6, 8]$  allows for 6 different matrices resulting in the given row and column totals 
 $B_i = [8, 6, 0, 0], A_i=[0, 0, 6, 8]$  allows for 7 different matrices resulting in the given row and column totals 
 
 Any guidance on how to tackle this is much appretiated. Any tips on how to generalize the solution to  $ n > 4 $  are also much appretiated.

 $$\int_0^\infty \frac1{(1+z)^{2+\gamma}} \ _2F_1\left(1+\frac\gamma2,\frac32;3;\frac{4z}{(1+z)^2}\right)\,dz=\frac{\Gamma\left(-\frac\gamma2\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{\gamma-1}2\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{1-\gamma}2\right)\Gamma\left(\frac\gamma2\right)}.$$ 
 
 I can do the first two steps: writing the Gauss Hypergeometric function in series and integrating, but I don't know how to ""sum again"" to get the neat result. Let me first explain the notations. Here  $\gamma\in(0,1)$  is a given parameter and  $\Gamma$  is the  Gamma function . The  Gauss Hypergeometric function  is defined for  $|z|<1$  by the series
 $$_2F_1(a,b;c;z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(a)_n(b)_n}{(c)_n}\frac{z^n}{n!},$$ 
where the (rising)  Pochhammer symbol   $(x)_n$  is defined by
 $$(x)_n=\begin{cases} 1, & n=0,\\ x(x+1)\cdots(x+n-1), & n\geq1.\end{cases}$$ 
It follows from definition that  $(x)_n=\Gamma(x+n)/\Gamma(x)$  for  $x>0$ . 
 My calculation.  By definition,
 \begin{align*}
_2F_1\left(1+\frac\gamma2,\frac32;3;\frac{4z}{(1+z)^2}\right)&=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\left(1+\frac\gamma2\right)_n\left(\frac32\right)_n}{(3)_n}\frac1{n!}\left(\frac{4z}{(1+z)^2}\right)^n\\
&=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\Gamma\left(1+\frac\gamma2+n\right)}{\Gamma\left(1+\frac\gamma2\right)}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac32+n\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac32\right)}\frac{\Gamma\left(3\right)}{\Gamma\left(3+n\right)}\frac{4^n}{n!}\frac{z^n}{(1+z)^{2n}}.
\end{align*} 
Now, we do the integration. Change the variable  $z=\tan^2\theta$  gives that  $\frac{dz}{d\theta}=2\tan\theta\frac1{\cos^2\theta}$  and thus
 \begin{align*}
\int_0^\infty \frac{z^n}{(1+z)^{2+\gamma+2n}}\,dz&=2\int_0^{\frac\pi2}\frac{\tan^{2n}\theta}{(1+\tan^2\theta)^{2+\gamma+2n}}\tan\theta\frac1{\cos^2\theta}\,d\theta\\
&=2\int_0^{\frac\pi2}\cos^{2n+2\gamma+1}\theta\sin^{2n+1}\theta\,d\theta\\
&=B(n+\gamma+1,n+1)=\frac{n!\Gamma(n+\gamma+1)}{\Gamma(2n+\gamma+2)}.
\end{align*} 
Therefore,
 $$\int_0^\infty \frac1{(1+z)^{2+\gamma}} \ _2F_1\left(1+\frac\gamma2,\frac32;3;\frac{4z}{(1+z)^2}\right)\,dz=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\Gamma\left(1+\frac\gamma2+n\right)}{\Gamma\left(1+\frac\gamma2\right)}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac32+n\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac32\right)}\frac{2\cdot 4^n}{(n+2)!}\frac{\Gamma(n+\gamma+1)}{\Gamma(2n+\gamma+2)}.$$ 
I can do a little more cancellation between the the numerator and the denominator. But I still don't know how to calculate the sum even after the simplication. 
 Any help would be appreciated!

"When reading algebraic geometry (on the technique of base change) in the book  Algebraic Geometry 1 - Schemes  by Ulrich Gortz, et.al, I came up with the following tensor product:
 $$
A_s = k[U,T,S]/(UT-S) \otimes_{k[S]} k[S]/(S-s), \quad \quad (\star)
$$ 
and the author claimed that
 $$
A_s = k[U,T] / (UT-s).      \quad \quad (\star\star)
$$ 
My  question  is: how to simplify  $(\star)$  to  $(\star\star)$ ? 
 More on this question: 
 I have read Atiyah and MacDonald's Comm. Algebra and know what a tensor product is. Yet I have not been familiar with the concrete calculation of tensor products (though I know the universal property of tensor products, its relation with localization, its exactness and etc.) 
 So beside the above question, I hope to know that  what is going on in your mind when calculating the tensor product ? 
 For example, when calculating the quotient ring  $k[x,y]/(y-x^2)$ , we can imagine that  $y-x^2 = 0$  and hence  $y=x^2$ , then in the ring  $k[x,y]$ , we can make  $y$  be  $x^2$  and the quotient ring is isomorphic to  $k[x]$ . 
 For example, when calculating the quotient ring  $k[x,y]/(1-xy)$ , we can imagine that  $xy=1$  and hence  $y=1/x$ , then in the ring  $k[x,y]$ , we can make  $y$  be  $1/x$  and the quotient ring is isomorphic to  $k[x, 1/x]$ , or the localization  $k[x]_{x}$ . 
 Then, when calculating the tensor product, is there a way like these above in mind to help us calculate these? 
 Thank you all! :)

"Question : A sample size of 10 is taken with replacement from an urn that contains 100 balls, which are numbered 1, 2, ..., 100. (At each draw, each ball has the same probability of being selected). 
 There are 3 parts to the question, and I've included my work below. However, I'm not sure if independence applies in part ii and iii. 
 i)  P(ball 1 is in the sample) = 1 - P(ball 1 is not in the sample) = $$1 - (\frac{99}{100})^{10}$$ 
 ii)  P(neither ball 1 nor ball 2 are in the sample) = P($(1 ∪ 2)^c)$ = 1 - P(1 ∪ 2) = 1 - [P(1) + P(2) - P(1 n 2)]  
 I think that P(1) = P(2), but I'm not sure if I can apply independence here and assume that P(1 n 2) = P(1) * P(2). 
 Since we are sampling with replacement, does this mean that we can assume the event: ball 1 is in the sample, and event: ball 2 is in the sample are independent? 
 iii)  Explain how you could calculate (with formulas) P(ball 1 is in the sample | ball 2 is in the sample). 
 If the two events are independent, then the probability would equal P(ball 1 is in the sample), but I'm confused as to whether I can assume independence.

"I'm trying to understand the constraints resulting from differentiating an unit normal field $N$ on a surface $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.  If I write the unit-length constraint at a point $p \in S$,
I have: 
$$\langle N(p), N(p) \rangle = 1$$ 
 Here, the angle brackets correspond to the standard dot product in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
(For notational simplicity, I'll leave out the $p$ from now on.)  I can take a directional derivative of this equation in the direction $\vec{v} \in T_p S$ to get: 
 $$ \langle D_\vec{v} N, N \rangle + \langle N, D_{\vec{v}} N \rangle = 0  $$ 
 This shows that the image of the differential of the Gauss Map lies in $T_p (S)$. 
 I can continue along this analysis, taking more and more directional derivatives to get constraints on the higher derivatives, e.g if $\vec{u} \in T_p (S)$ 
 $$ \langle D_{\vec{u}} (D_\vec{v} N), N \rangle + \langle  D_\vec{v} N, D_\vec{u} N \rangle + \langle  D_\vec{u} N, D_\vec{v} N \rangle + \langle N, D_{\vec{u}}(D_{\vec{v}} N)\rangle = 0 $$ 
 I would like to think of this process in tensorial terms -- that is, terms like $D_{\vec{u}} (D_\vec{v} N)$ can be considered as a $(1, 2)$ tensor.  So, let me write $D_{\vec{u}} (D_\vec{v} N)$ as $D^2 N$ and so on.
For example, if I take $m$ derivatives, I will get terms such as T = $\langle D^i N, D^j N \rangle$ where $i + j = m$. I believe I can think of $T$ as a $(0, m)$ tensor, where I place the first $i$ inputs into the $D^i N$ and the next $j$ inputs into the $D^j N$.  To be more precise, I think I need to consider $D^i N$ as a (1, i) tensor and $D^j N$ as a (1, j) tensor and then the dot product forms some kind of contraction.   
 My question involves how to represent these terms via arrays and computation. How do I represent a single term like $T$ as a m-dimensional array that can take in $m$ vectors?  For now, I would just like to verify (via code and a given surface, so I can calculate derivatives of the normal field of any order) that if I sum up the L.H.S of each equation, I will get 0.  But how do I express these tensors correctly? I do not want to choose my directions (like $\vec{v}, \vec{u}$) explicitly, but instead write the tensor formulations as arrays of numbers in a tangent plane basis.  So, when I sum up all the terms, I should get a m-dimensional array of zeros. 
 I think I need to be careful, as there is an ordering of inputs that notation like $D^i N$ hides.   That is, there will be multiple terms involved of the same order derivatives, but involving different input vectors.  For example, if my first three inputs are $\{\vec{v}, \vec{u}, \vec{w}\}$, I don't think I can consider the tensor $\langle D_\vec{u} (D_\vec{v} N), D_\vec{w} N \rangle$ as equal to the tensor $\langle D_\vec{w} (D_\vec{v} N), D_\vec{u} N \rangle$.  Thus, I believe I will need to rearrange dimensions of these arrays in a proper fashion.  But I don't know what ""proper"" is. 
 I apologize if this writeup is unclear; please ask for clarification if needed.  And thank you so much for any enlightenment you can give me!  Even a suitable reference would be much appreciated! 
 EDIT:  
 To be more precise about my confusion:  Suppose I take $n$ derivatives.  I will have terms like $D^i N$, with $i < n$.  Although an individual $D^i N$ is a $2 \times 2 \cdots \times 2 \times 3$ array, with $i + 1$ total dimensions, I need to ""embed"" it as a $n + 1$ dimensional array in order to dot product it or sum it with the various other terms in the equation.  This is because the different $D^i N$ terms are tensors acting on different sets of input vectors.  So, to combine these different tensors, I need to place them all in the same space -- the space of $(1, n)$ tensors. 
 If I know my normal field and surface completely, this should just be a matter of bookkeeping.  I believe I just pad certain dimensions (corresponding to the unused inputs) of the arrays with copies of the rows from the dimensions of the used inputs.  In this fashion, these tensors will be independent of the set of $n - i$ unused inputs. Is this correct?

"I want to calculate the surface area of the part of a half-sphere, which lies above a regular 6-gon. (Radius $r=1$) 
 More formally, 
Let $G$ be the region on the $XY$-Plane, bounded by the points $\{P_k=(\cos(\frac{2\pi k}{6}), \sin(\frac{2\pi k}{6}))\}$ for $k=1, ..., 6$. It's just the hexagon whose nodes are on the unit circle. 
 I want to calculate the area of $S_G = \{(x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \ |\ x^2+y^2+z^2 =1, \ z>0, \ and \ (x,y)\in G \}$. 
 What I did: 
 Similar to how one computes the sphere's area, I took $F(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2-1=0$, and eventually got to $Area(S_G)=\int_G{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}}dx dy}$. 
 Seems kind of nasty since $G$ is not a nice domain to work on with polar coordinates (that would have helped if my domain was ""round"" in some way, because then it reduces to $\int{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-s}}ds}$ ).

"I have the following situation. I've got a 2d plane in which I have drawn a rectangle (red). This is done by picking a point (big red dot), and using the vanishing points calculated by some other lines on the image, and a set width/height of the rectangle to calculate the other 3 points. This part works fine. 
 Now, I when I select another point (big blue dot), I can calculate the other points as well, I'm just stuck on getting the width/height to transform correctly. Currently, they are the same as the red rectangle, which is obviously wrong (blue rectangle) since they should be smaller closer to the vanishing point (green rectangle is the way I need it to be).   
 The image below is a sketch of my current situation. 
 I know the coordinates of some intersections on parallel lines in the plane (green dots), so I thought I could do some calculations with that (ie. you know the difference of the length of the horizontal lines in relation to the y-shift?), I just can't figure out the correct formula, should be something like a natural logarithm? (since the width/height should decrease exponentially i think as they approach the vanishing point?).

 I can store values for a frame, and I can also consume them or previous values and map into A.

 With 5 tries this would be easy: take  $(1/6)$  to fifth power. 
 With 6 tries this is manageable; take the probability of rolling 6 the first five times, add the probability of rolling 6 the last five times, then subtract the overlap (all six results are 6). 
 Given two overlapping sets of 5 rolls, the probability that one is all 6's is not independent from the probability that the other is all 6's.

 Is the following Poisson boundary value problem  well-posed , as stated? 
 
 If so, how could I go about solving it? 
 If not, what would it need to be well-posed? 
 
 
 Does it satisfy the ""compatibility constraint"" mentioned in the  Update  section below? 
 (Bonus!) Are there any potential issues for solving this  numerically  (e.g. using an implicit finite difference scheme to solve for  $\Phi$ )? 
 
 My Approaches Thus Far 
 I have tried solving this numerically in  MATLAB  and  Mathematica . Both programs claim to have solved the problem, but upon inspection, neither the governing equation nor any of the boundary conditions are enforced! 
 Here's the problem: 
 It's an axisymmetric Poisson problem in spherical coordinates. 
 Domain 
 
 $0 < R_{min} \le r \le R_{max}$ 
 $0 < \theta_{min} \le \theta \le \theta_{max} < \pi$ 
 
 Governing Equation 
 
 $2 r \frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial r} + r^2 \frac{\partial^2\Phi}{\partial r^2} + \cot \theta \frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial\theta} + \frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial\theta^2}  = \frac{A}{8 \pi r^2} \csc\theta \left(1+3 \cos(2 \theta)\right) $ 
 
 The constant  $A$  is known. 
 Radial Boundary Conditions 
 
 $ \frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial r} \bigg|_{r \rightarrow R_{min}}  = -\frac{A \sin \theta}{4 \pi R_{min}^3}$ 
 $ \frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial r} \bigg|_{r \rightarrow R_{max}}  = -\frac{A \sin \theta}{4 \pi R_{max}^3}$ 
 
 Latitudinal Boundary Conditions 
 
 $\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial\theta} \bigg|_{\theta \rightarrow \theta_{min}}  = \frac{A \cos \left(\theta_{min}\right)}{2 \pi r^2}$ 
 $\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial\theta} \bigg|_{\theta \rightarrow \theta_{max}}  = \frac{A \cos \left(\theta_{max}\right)}{2 \pi r^2}$ 
 
 Additional Constraint(?) 
 Since  $\Phi(r,\theta)$  is only constrained by its derivatives, its solution is only uniquely determined up to an additive constant. That is, since  $\vec{\nabla} \Phi = \vec{\nabla} \left(\Phi + C\right)$ , where  $C$  is a uniform constant, we need to specify a value for  $\Phi(r,\theta)$  at some point we'll call ( $r^\star, \theta^\star$ ): 
 
 $\Phi(r^\star, \theta^\star) = C$ 
 
 in order to get a unique solution. The particular value of  $C$  is irrelevant for me, since I'm only interested in the gradient of  $\Phi$  anyway. 
 Background 
 
 The equations given above are greatly-simplified versions of a more general problem I am tackling in my research. 
 Physically, I'm using the electric scalar potential to calculate the electric field in the given domain, which is an 2D (axisymmetric) slice of a sphere. 
 Later, it would be neat for the domain to extend to the poles, but for simplicity (and for numerics' sake!), I want the domain to stop short of the poles. 
 
 Update! 
 Evidently, the problem should satisfy a compatibility constraint. See §1.3 of  this document  for details. I'm not sure how it applies to this PDE, but I would like this to be addressed in the answer.

  girls, do we have enough information to calculate the percentage of
  the group that have passed the exam? [$68.75\%$]

"I am a third year undergraduate mathematics student. 
 I learned some basic techniques for simplifying sums in high school algebra, but I have encountered some of the more interesting techniques in my combinatorics classes and math contests. Many of my favorite techniques involve showing some sort of bijection between things. 
 However, I feel that I have learned almost no new cool integration technique since I took the AP Calculus exam in high school. The first combinatorics book I remember reading had a large chunk devoted to interesting techniques for evaluating summations, preferably with bijective techniques. I have yet to encounter a satisfying analog for integrals. 
 There are two main things I have had difficulty finding out much about: 
 
 What ""subject"" (perhaps a course I can take, or a book I can look up) might I look into for finding a plethora of interesting techniques for calculating integrals (e.g. for summations I might take a course in combinatorics or read ""Concrete Mathematics"" by Knuth et al)? 
 I am particularly interested in analogs for ""bijective proofs"" for integrals. Perhaps there are techniques that look for geometric interpretation of integrals that makes this possible? I often love ""bijective proofs"" because there is often almost no error-prone calculi involved. In fact, I often colloquially define ""bijective proofs"" this way--as any method of proof in which the solution becomes obvious from interpreting the problem in more than one way.

"I'm working on a computer vision project where I'm trying to detect a moving colored circle (doughnut actually). After some work I'm able to get it working pretty well except for these two edge cases. My results are always a small set of approximately 5-10 points that describe a circle. Then I can calculate the ""center of mass"" of the object.  When this comes out right like a circle I get the center coordinates correctly. But when it comes out like the sketches below the center point is off. 
 The first image is the result of a little extra object being detected, and the second case is usually the camera occluding part of the image or sometimes an aggressive light source. A lot of my error cases have part of a circle in them. 
 So I've been trying to think if there is a neat mathematical way to identify each edge case, and then solve it, by figuring out where the real center would be of a circle that fit to it.  I can see how to approach this from a trial and error convergence sort of approach.  But I thought there might be something smarter I hadn't thought of.

x = 2^{x_1} \cdot 3^{y_1}\\
y = 2^{x_2} \cdot 3^{y_2}\\
z = 2^{x_3} \cdot 3^{y_3}
\end{cases}
$$ 
 Now $2^{x_1+x_2+x_3} \cdot 3^{y_1+y_2+y_3} = 2^3 \cdot 3$, so 
 $$
\begin{cases}
x_1+x_2+x_3 = 3\\
y_1+y_2+y_3 = 1
\end{cases}
$$ 
 where $x_1,x_2,x_3,y_1,y_2,y_3\geq 0$. Thus the number of solutions for the first is $\binom{5}{2}=10$ and second is $\binom{3}{2}=3$. This gives a total number of positive solutions of $10 \cdot 3 = 30$

, but I am still a bit unsure after reading the answers as to when the integral gives you a positive area and when it gives you a negative area. My text book says that the area is positive if t traces out the curve clockwise and negative for anticlockwise, however I think there is more going on with regards to whether the curve is above or below the x axis. 
 Since $A=\int_a^b y\frac{dx}{dt}dt$, my guess is that you get a positive answer if either the graph is above the x axis (y is positive) and the point is moving to the right (dx/dt positive) or the graph is below the x axis and the point is moving to the left. Then you get a negative answer if either the graph is below the x axis but is being traced out moving to the right, or the graph is above the x axis but is being traced out moving to the left.

"All of us know the way to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle: Using the Pythagorean Theorem.  
 I came up with a substitute to this. Let the shortest leg of the right triangle be '$a$' units, and the relatively bigger leg be '$b$' units, where $a < b < \text{Hypotenuse}$. 
 My theorem is that in such a case, there will always be a variable '$x$' such that: 
 $a^2 - x^2 =2bx$.  
 As for the applications of this statement, we can find the hypotenuse of the triangle by finding the positive root of this equation, and then added to the biggest leg to obtain the value of the hypotenuse. I derived a few basic conclusions from The Dickson's method of generating Pythagorean Triples, to prove this. 
 Let us give it a try: 
 Let $a = 5$, $b = 12$. 
 $a^2-x^2=2bx$.  
 $25-x^2=24x$ 
 $x^2+24x-25=0$ 
 $x=1,-5$. 
 Therefore hypotenuse $= 12+1=13$, which satisfies Pythagorean Theorem.
This satisfies only the triangles which have unequal sides.
Obviously, we don't need a substitute for isosceles right triangles since given the legs '$a$', the hypotenuse is $a\sqrt{2}$. 
 My questions are: 
 
 Can the difficulty level of application of this theorem be compared to that of Pythagoras? If so, in the general case, is this difficult or easy to apply? 
 Are there any more possible practical applications of this theorem (like in geometric proofs)?

The probability of getting at least 4 successes (4 points or more) can be calculated too, using the binomial, and is 0.06972.
If I consider the other event (rolling a 6), I can calculate the probability of getting at least 2 successes (4 points) in a similar way, it is 0.5154.
But how do I calculate the probability of getting at least 4 points? I cannot add the probabilities because there is a nonzero chance of both events occurring at the same time, and there is also a probability of no one of them happening, and getting 4 points anyway (if I roll one 6 and three 5s, for example). Of course I could do a computer simulation and calculate it by brute force, but this is just a simplification of the actual problem I´m facing, so I´m wondering if somebody could come up with an algebraic solution to it.
Thank you all in advance!

"I'm familiar with the  steady-state behavior of an M/M/1 queue . For example, the arrival rate of  $\lambda = 2$  per minute and servicing rate of  $\mu = 3$  per minute means that utilization  $\rho = \lambda / \mu = \frac{2}{3}$ , and therefore the steady-state probability in each state  $k$  is  $(1-\rho)\rho^k$ , or the following: 
 
 $\mathrm{Pr}(k=0) = 1/3$ 
 $\mathrm{Pr}(k=1) = 2/9$ 
 $\mathrm{Pr}(k=2) = 4/27$ 
 $\mathrm{Pr}(k=3) = 8/81$

 This seems like it should be a well-known problem, but I can't seem to find it in the basic tutorials/textbooks on queueing theory.

"In a generalization of this problem:  Integral involving product of arctangent and Gaussian , I am trying to calculate the integral 
 $$ I(a,b) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} \arctan^2 {\left( \frac{y+b}{x+a} \right)} e^{- (x^2 + y^2)} d x d y , $$ 
 for  $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$  in terms of commonly used special functions. The substitution that worked in the aforementioned question, i.e. 
 $$ \frac{1}{(x+a) \sqrt{\pi}} \arctan{ \left( \frac{y+b}{x+a} \right) } = \int_0^{\infty} \mathrm{erf} ((y+b)s) e^{-(x+a)^2 s^2} d s , $$ 
 where  $\mathrm{erf}(z) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^z e^{-t^2} d t$  is the standard error function, forces us to consider the integral 
 $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}} \mathrm{erf} ((y+b)t) \mathrm{erf} ((y+b)s) e^{- y^2} d y . $$ 
 In the case of  $b = 0$ , we may use the result 
 $$ \int_0^{\infty} \mathrm{erf}{(ax)} \mathrm{erf}{(bx)} e^{-c^2 x^2} d x = \frac{1}{c \sqrt{\pi}} \arctan{\left( \frac{ab}{c \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} \right)} $$ 
 found in, e.g., formula (18) of page 158 of  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/75B/jresv75Bn3-4p149_A1b.pdf . Making this substitution, we find 
 $$ I(a,0) =  \pi \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^{\infty} r \arctan{ \left( \frac{r \cos{\theta}\sin{\theta}}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} \right) } \exp{ \left\lbrace - \frac{a^2 r^2}{1 + r^2} \right\rbrace} \frac{(1 + 2 a^2 + r^2)}{(1+r^2)^{5/2}} d \theta d r . $$ 
 I would be very happy just to demonstrate a closed-form for  $I(a,0)$  above. However, now I am stuck trying to compute 
 \begin{align}
\int_0^{\pi / 2} \arctan{ \left( \frac{r \cos{\theta}\sin{\theta}}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} \right) } d \theta . \hspace{2cm} (*)
\end{align} 
 Would anyone on this platform know how to compute ( $*$ )? I have tried Mathematica, but it returns some nasty expression. Maybe I am going about this wrong by trying to compute the  $\theta$  integral first? Any ideas about ( $*$ ) or the original integral  $I(a,b)$  are appreciated. I asked about a related integral here:  Integral involving sin, cosine, exponential, and error functions. . The integral in this question is found by starting from polar coordinates with  $I(a,b)$ . Unfortunately, I have not been able to make progress on this integral either. 
 Update:  Observe that 
 $$ \frac{d}{dr} \frac{e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)}}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} = - r \exp{ \left\lbrace - \frac{a^2 r^2}{1 + r^2} \right\rbrace} \frac{(1 + 2 a^2 + r^2)}{(1+r^2)^{5/2}} . $$ 
 We may therefore integrate-by-parts to find 
 \begin{align*}
I(a,0) & = - \pi \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^{\infty} \arctan{ \left( \frac{r \cos{\theta}\sin{\theta}}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} \right) } \frac{d}{dr} \frac{e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)}}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} dr d \theta \\
& ​= \pi \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\cos{\theta} \sin{\theta}}{(1+r^2) (1 + r^2 ( 1 + \cos^2{\theta} \sin^2{\theta} )) } e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)} dr d \theta .
\end{align*} 
 Hopefully this observation simplifies the problem some. Apparently, Mathematica believes 
 $$ \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos{\theta} \sin{\theta}}{1 + r^2 ( 1 + \cos^2{\theta} \sin^2{\theta} ) } d \theta = \frac{2 \mathrm{arctanh}{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} }}{r \sqrt{ 5 r^2  + 4 } } , $$ 
 where  $\mathrm{arctanh}$  is the inverse hyperbolic tangent. I haven't been able to derive this myself though. 
 Update 2:  I was able to make a little more progress on the special case  $I(a,0)$ . Starting from the previous identity involving the hyperbolic  $\mathrm{arctanh}$ , our integral of interest becomes
 \begin{align*}
I(a,0) = 2 \pi \int_0^{\infty} \frac{2 \mathrm{arctanh}{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} }}{r (1 + r^2) \sqrt{ 5 r^2  + 4 } } e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)} d r .
\end{align*} 
Now, observe that
 \begin{align*}
\frac{d }{d r} \mathrm{arctanh}^2{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} } = 2 \frac{\mathrm{arctanh}{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} }}{(1+r^2) \sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} . 
\end{align*} 
Then, via integration-by-parts,
 \begin{align*}
I(a,0) & = 2 \pi \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{r} e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)} \frac{d }{d r} \mathrm{arctanh}^2{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} } d r \\
& = 2 \pi \int_0^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{r^2} + \frac{2a^2}{(1+r^2)^2} \right) e^{- a^2 r^2 / (1+r^2)} \mathrm{arctanh}^2{ \frac{r}{\sqrt{5 r^2 + 4}} } d r . 
\end{align*} 
Now we look to making the Euler substitution to simplify the integral. Let  $\sqrt{ 5 r^2 + 4 } = \sqrt{5} r + t$ . Then,
 \begin{align*}
r = \frac{4 - t^2}{2 \sqrt{5} t} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{10} \left( \frac{4}{t} - t \right).  
\end{align*} 
Consequently,
 \begin{align*}
d r = - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{10} \left( \frac{4}{t^2} + 1 \right) d t . 
\end{align*} 
Plugging this into our integral and simplifying reveals
 \begin{align}
I(a,0) = 4 \pi \sqrt{5}  \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} (4 + t^2) \left( \frac{1}{(t^2 - 4)^2} + \frac{40 a^2 t^2}{(t^4 + 12 t^2 + 16)^2} \right) e^{- \frac{a^2 (t^2 - 4)^2}{16+12t+t^2}} \mathrm{arctanh}^2{ \left( \frac{t^2 - 4}{ \sqrt{5} (t^2 + 4)} \right) } d t .   
\end{align} 
 It is starting to seem as though some ""closed-form"" in terms of  $a$  is possible. Due to the appearance of  $\mathrm{arctanh}^2$  in the previous integral, I am inclined to conjecture that  $\mathrm{arctanh}$  is part of the final answer. This would be a nice ""duality"" with this integral and the final answer to the related one in the question linked at the very top. 
 Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could proceed?

"I am writing an essay for my calculus class and one of the requirements to meet within the essay is to demonstrate an understanding of integration by explaining a metaphor that uses integration.  
 This is the passage that I think meets that requirement but I am not sure if I should expand more on integration just to be sure:  
 
 To a person familiar with integration
  attempting to relate the metaphor back
  to math, this statement likely brings
  to mind images of their first calculus
  instructor drawing rectangles below a
  function when showing the class how to
  calculate the area under a curve. The
  reason Tolstoy’s statement conjures this reminiscent math memory to
  is because the two concepts being
  discussed are abstractly identical.
  Just as the wills of man that direct
  the compass of history are
  innumerable, so are the number of
  rectangles that are required to be
  summed to get an exact measurement of
  area under a curve. Despite the
  impossibility of calculating an
  infinite amount of something we must
  still calculate some amount of it if
  we wish to obtain the valuable
  information an approximation can
  provide. 
 
 For reference, here is the metaphor I am writing about: 
 
 ""The movement of humanity, arising as
  it does from innumerable arbitrary
  human wills, is continuous. To
  understand the laws of this continuous
  movement is the aim of history. . . .
  Only by taking inﬁnitesimally small
  units for observation (the diﬀerential
  of history, that is, the individual
  tendencies of men) and attaining to
  the art of integrating them (that is,
  ﬁnding the sum of these inﬁnitesimals)
  can we hope to arrive at the laws of
  history""

 ABCD is a unit square and E is a point inside it, such that angle CED is right and  $\frac {DE}{AE} = \frac {4}{5}$ .
Calculate the area of ECBAE (green area). 
 
 Although Geometry is not my strong point, I have tried the following:
By drawing a vertical from E to AD (h = altitude of triangle AED), this splits the side AD into 2 parts, say x and y. Knowing also that  $ED = 4k$  and  $EA = 5k$ , we apply Pythagoras twice, having also  $x+y=1$ . By this, we get a relation between x and y:  $y-x = 9k^2$ .
But we have 3 unknowns, so I am not getting anywhere...
Then we could also apply Pythagoras in right triangle CED and calculate EC and then get the areas of both triangles and deduct from the area of the square, which is 1. 
 By the way, Geogebra gives a number near 0.41 for the area in question. Thank you in advance!

"I have two expressions:  $t_1$  and  $t_2$ . I want to calculate division  $t_1 / t_2$  when the parameters  $r_1 = r_2$ . This condition  $r_1 = r_2$  causes the denominators of  $t_1$  and  $t_2$  to be indeterminate. So to avoid this indeterminacy I suppose that  $r_1$  is different from  $r_2$ . By making this assumption that  $r_1$  is different from  $r_2$  I get the division  $t_1 / t_2$ . And for this division  $t_1 / t_2$  I apply the limit when  $r_1$  tends to  $r_2$ . The limit when  $r_1$  tends to  $r_2$  is calculated due to the indeterminacy whose cause is  $r_1 = r_2$ . When calculating this limit, the expression  $t_1 / t_2$  converges to  $-1$ . However, even though the expression converges to  $-1$ , when taking almost equal values ​of  $r_1$  and  $r_2$ , the expression takes on a different value. This value when  $r_1$  is almost equal to  $r_2$  the expression is equal to  $1.5$ . 
 $$t_1=\frac{-\sqrt{r_1 r_2 \left(K_1^2 r_1 r_2+K_1 K_2 \left(r_1^2+r_2^2\right)+K_2^2 r_1
   r_2\right)}+K_1 r_1 r_2+K_2 r_1^2}{(r_1-r_2) (K_1 r_2+K_2 r_1)}$$

 This for me is counterintuitive because the limit is  $-1$  but when using values the expression does not get closer to  $-1$  and is rather  $1.5$   
 What could I improve? I want find the real limit value, that in this case is  $1.5$

"I want to calculate the area of this region that I'm showing in the picture.
First of all, I think that the area that the exercise refers to is the area I painted black on my 2nd pic. 
 I think it must be done with double integrals. 
 My first guess was to do the integrals with polar coordinates but I encountered the following problem (that I think that never happened to me before): I can't find an explicit equation in polar coordinates for that thing. And if I can't do that, how am I supposed to calculate that with polar coordinates?? 
 My 2nd guess was solving it with cartesian coordinates. I've decided to do  $2$  separate integrals (Only because I can't do it in a single one). I divided the region into  $2$ ,  $I_1$  and  $I_2$  (shown in the 3rd pic). 
 $I_1$ : 
 $$ 1- \sqrt(1- \frac{(x-2)^2}{4}) < y < x $$ 
 $$ 0.4<x<2 $$ 
 $I_2$ : 
 $$0<y<2$$ 
 $$ 2<x<2+\sqrt{4-4(y-1)^2} $$   
 In fact, the exercise doesn't ask to calculate the area, it asks the center of mass of that shape (with a uniform density), but my main problem is to do the set up of the area integral 
 $$y\le x, x^2 + 4y^2 - 4x - 8y +4 \le 0.$$

 In other words, if I was to do that test 100 times and the observed mean was calculated to be 6, how can I calculate the probability that the deviation in the mean could be because of random chance, as opposed to the underlying (assumed) statistical model being incorrect (i.e. the dice being biased)?

 In  $ A=\mathbb{Z}[i]=\{a+bi \ : \ a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\} $  we consider  $a=7+56i; \ b=3+3i; \ c=1+8i$ . We will write  $(a)$  to refer to the ideal generated by  $a$ 
 1.- Prove that  $\frac{A}{(a)}$  isn’t a field. Where   $\frac{A}{(a)}$  is the quotient ring of  $A$  by the ideal generated by  $a$ .  
 However, prove there exists an isomorphism between  $\frac{A}{(a)}$  and  $A \times B \times C$  where  $A,B,C$  are three fields.  
 2.- Find out whether the elements  $\overline{b}:= b + (a), \ \overline{c} \in \frac{A}{(a)}$  are invertible elements in  $\frac{A}{(a)}$  or not. If they are, calculate their inverses.  
 EDIT: With the help of the answers below I’ve managed to do the following. 
 1.- A is an Euclidean domain, so it is a PID. 
Let  $N$  be the norm application, so  $N(a)=3185=5\cdot 637 = (7+56i)(7-56i)$  therefore  $a$  isn’t prime in  $A$ , as a result  $(a)$  isn’t a prime ideal in  $A$ . This implies  $(a)$  isn’t a maximal ideal in the set of principal ideals of  $A$ , but  $A$  is a PDI so  $(a)$  isn’t maximal in  $A$  so   $\frac{A}{(a)}$   isn’t a field. 
 For the second part, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem, if we can express  $(a)$  as the intersection of three coprime ideals (i.e I.J coprime ideals iff  $I+J=A$ ) we can make use of it. 
 $a=7(1+8i)$  and  $N(1+8i)=65=5 \cdot 13 = (2+i)(2-i)13$  and one can easily check that  $(1+8i)/(2+i)=2+3i$ . That gives us  $a=7(2+i)(2+3i)$  where all of them are prime in  $A$  therefore their ideals are prime too. (I haven’t managed to see if they are coprime) 
 We also know that  $(n) \cap (m)=(lcm(m,n))$  and as   $a=7(2+i)(2+3i)$  we have  $(a)=(7) \cap(2+i) \cap(2+3i)$  but all of them are prime, so that intersection equals the product of all of them.  
 Now by the Chinese Remainder Theorem we get that there exists an isomorphism  
 $$
f: \frac{A}{(a)} \longrightarrow \frac{A}{(7)} \times \frac{A}{(2+i)} \times \frac{A}{(2+3i)}
$$ 
where those quotient rings are fields since their ideals are prime which implies maximal.  
 2.- I’m still stuck on this one, but I’ve managed to do something:
To see if  $\overline{b}$  is invertirle we have to find  $\overline{t}$  such that  $\overline{b} \overline{t}= \overline{1}$  which translates into  $\overline{1-bt}=0 \Rightarrow 1-bt \in (a) \Rightarrow \lambda a =1-bt \Rightarrow 1=\lambda a +bt $  and this last expression I know it’s a Bézout Identity but I don’t know how to work with it in  $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ .

 I think i'm into the right way. I just dunno how to calculate the probability using the properties. Here what i tought: 
 Let $p$ denote the probability associated with every entry. Let det$M$ = $a_1a_4 - a_3a_2$. We define the following events: 
 $A_i=$ the product $a_1a_4$ is equal to $i$, where $i=0,1$. 
 $B_i$= the product $a_3a_2$ is equal to $i$, where $i=0,1$. 
 $E_{kj}$ = the entrance $a_k$ has value $j$, for $k=1,...,4$ and $j=0,1$. 
 The event $F$: the determinant is positive happens when the determinant is equal to zero or one. Ie, $F=D_0\cup D_1$, where $D_i$= the determinant has value $i$, for $i=0,1$. 
 Therefore, we may write: 
 $D_0 = A_1B_1 \cup A_0B_0$  
 $D_1=A_1B_0$ 
 And 
 $A_1=E_{11}E_{41}$

Define  $a=xz$ , then  $\sin(a) = \sin(xz)$

"Let's consider this situation. We have $3$ different $6$-sided dice. The first die has five blank sides + one '$1$' side. The second die has four blank sides + two '$1$' sides. The third die has $4$ blank sides + one '$1$' side + one '$2$' side. 
 In an other form :
1st die : $1,0,0,0,0,0$
2nd die : $1,1,0,0,0,0$
3rd die : $1,2,0,0,0,0$ 
 I am trying to calculate the different probabilities of each possible sum outcome (sum of $0,1,2,3$ and $4$).  
 Would it be fair to assume that what follows is true? 
 The probability of having a sum of $1$ on the $3$ dice is equal to (1st dice, 2nd dice, third dice) :
$\frac{1}{6} (1) \times \frac{4}{6} (0) \times \frac{4}{6} (0)  +  \frac{5}{6} (0) \times \frac{2}{6} (1) \times \frac{4}{6} (0) + \frac{5}{6} (0) \times \frac{4}{6} (0) \times \frac{1}{6} (1) = \frac{76}{216}$ or $35.19\%$ 
 For the sum of $1$, I assumed that to have this sum, only one die can have '$1$' and the other two '$0$' so I find the probability for each set of dice (chance of '$1$' $\times$ chance of not '$1$' $\times$ chance of not '$1$'). I understand that this will be different for the sum of $2$ since the dice combination will be different (sometimes only $1$ dice is needed while the other time two dice will be needed) but I would like to confirm that my reasoning is accurate.  
 I am terrible with the notions of probability and it's been a few days now that this has been in my head and I wasn't able to find an answer to my assumption anywhere on the internet since I don't know how to really word it.

"I recently took a better look at the  operator norm  defined on a matrix $\mathbf A \in \Bbb{K}^{n\times n}$ as follows: 
 $$
\|\mathbf A\|_p=\sup\{\|\mathbf Ax\|_p \mid x\in\Bbb{K}^n\land\|x\|=1\}
$$ 
 The first time I looked at this I thought ""ok, lets calculate it for a few example matrices"". I started with $n = 3$ and $p = 2$, just to start ""simple"". Let
$$
\mathbf A = \left[\begin{matrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\end{matrix}\right]\quad a_{ij}\in\Bbb{K}^n
$$
Now if we're going to minimize $\|\mathbf Ax\|_2$ ($ = \|\mathbf Ax\|$), we might as well make it easy on ourselves and only minimize $\|\mathbf Ax\|^2$ so as to not worry about that annoying radical. We get
$$
\begin{align}
\|\mathbf Ax\|^2 & = (a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3)^2 + (a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3)^2 + (a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3)^2 \\
& = Ax_1^2 + Bx_2^2 + Cx_3^2 + Dx_1x_2 + Ex_1x_3 + Fx_2x_3
\end{align}
$$
where
$$
\begin{align}
A & = a_{11}^2+a_{21}^2+a_{31}^2 \\
B & = a_{12}^2+a_{22}^2+a_{32}^2 \\
C & = a_{13}^2+a_{23}^2+a_{33}^2 \\
D & = 2(a_{11}a_{12} + a_{21}a_{22} + a_{31}a_{33}) \\
E & = 2(a_{11}a_{13} + a_{21}a_{23} + a_{31}a_{33}) \\
F & = 2(a_{12}a_{13} + a_{22}a_{23} + a_{32}a_{33})
\end{align}
$$
Now lets define 
$$
G(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3) = Ax_1^2+Bx_2^2+Cx_3^2+Dx_1x_2+Ex_1x_3+Fx_2x_3
$$
So if we want to minimize $||\mathbf Ax||^2$, we're either going to have to minimize
$$
N(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3) = \frac{G(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3)}{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2}
$$
or simply minimize $G$ with the constraint $g(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = 1$. The latter seemed easier to me, so I gave it a shot using Lagrange multipliers. 
 As usual, I defined 
$$
\mathcal{L}(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3,\ \lambda) = G(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3)-\lambda g(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3)
$$
setting it's gradient to zero gives
$$
\nabla \mathcal L = 0 \implies \begin{cases}
2(A - \lambda)x_1 + Dx_2 + Ex_3 & = 0 \\
Dx_1 + 2(B - \lambda)x_2 + Fx_3 & = 0 \\
Ex_1 + Fx_2 + 2(C - \lambda)x_3 & = 0 \\
x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - 1 & = 0
\end{cases}
$$
Now this is where I really started to get stuck. I tried solving the first three equations for $x_1,\ x_2,$ and $x_3$ but didn't end up with anything I could use. I tried solving for $x_1$ in terms of $x_2,\ x_3,$ and $\lambda$, then $x_2$ in terms of $x_3$ and $\lambda$, and then subbing that all into the third equation, but ended up with either $x_3 = 0$ or 
$$
4\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2(A+B+C) + \lambda(4AB+4AC+4BC-D2+E^2+F^2)-4ABC-AF^2-BE^2+CD^2+DEF = 0
$$
which, although technically solvable for $\lambda$ via the cubic equation, would be incredibly messy. 
 Now, I probably created my own roadblock for this problem, because I didn't want to think about the system of equations logically and just wanted to bash it out. Regardless of my approach, it seems like the operator norm is a very difficult thing to calculate, and I only analyzed the case where $n = 3$ and $p = 2$. What about the general case? What if $n = 75$ and $p = 9/4$? How on earth would you calculate it then? 
 The questions above are rhetorical, however, and my actual question is as follows: 
 
 Why define such an ordinary norm for matrices which is so difficult to calculate in general? 
 
 I see the operator norm everywhere, and it seems like the standard norm for a lot of theorems (unless I'm mistaken and ||A|| just means  any  matrix norm). So why would we define such a standard norm in a way that is so difficult to calculate? What's the point? Is it easy to work with in theorems? I get that it intuitively makes sense as a norm, but it can't possibly be that easy to work with, especially in comparison to things like the Frobenius norm.  
 So why do we care about this definition?

 The problem: There are 10 cell phones on a single account. Each phone uses a different amount of SMS messages and data per month, somewhere between 0 and infinity. Example: Phone 1 uses 13 SMS and 2MB of data, Phone 2 uses 3 SMS and 15MB of data, etc 
 There are 5 different rate plans I can put each cell phone on. Each rate plan has a price-per-device, a maximum SMS use, and a maximum data use. 
 Example: Plan A price-per-sim = 1.20USD, max SMS use=20, maximum data use=2MB Plan B price-per-sim = 3.25USD, maximum SMS use = 150, maximum data use = 10MB 
 Each rate plan ""pools"" the maximum SMS use and maximum data use between all lines within each plan. If the plan's total SMS use is over its pooled SMS use, the extra is charged at 0.05USD/SMS. If the plan's total data use is over its pooled data use, the extra is charged at 0.35USD/MB 
 Example: 3 phones are on plan A use a total of 75 SMS and 10MB of data. Service charge = 3 *  $1.2 = 3.60USD, Pooled SMS = 3 * 20 = 60, overage = 75-60=15 SMS * 0.05USD = $ .75 overage, Pooled data = 3 * 2MB = 6MB, overage = 10MB - 6MB = 4MB *  $.35 = $ 1.40 overage Total plan A cost = 3.60USD + 0.75USD + 1.40USD = 5.75USD Total cost of the account would be that same process for all the rate plans. 
 I can make the change right up until the last day of the month, and whatever plan the phone is on at the end of the month will be used to calculate that month's use/overage. So my ultimate question is ""What plan should each phone be on that will give me the lowest total account bill?""

"A bitstring is defined by a sequence of ones and zeros, e.g. ""0101110111"". Equivalently, it is defined by an integer as its binary representation. 
 I want to calculate a certain function of a bitstring for all bitstrings of a certain length $l$. This is equivalent to calculating that function for all integers from 0 up to $2^l-1$ 
 I want to optimize my code by making less computation. I have noticed that if the difference between previous and next bitstring is only in 1 arbitrary bit (e.g. for ""110010"" and ""111010"" only the 3rd bit differs), the result of the function for the previous bitstring can be reused to significantly decrease the computation cost of the function for the next bitstring.

 00 -> 01 -> 10 -> 11: the second step has difference of 2 bits

"Calculate the sum of the infinite series 
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(3n)!}$$ by solving an aptly chosen differential equation. 
 I know that one can solve a differential equation by assuming that we can write the solution as a power series in the form
$$y(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x-x_0)^n$$ and then find all the different values for $a_n$'s. I'm trying to figure out how to to it the other way around? How am I supposed to find the differential equation when I have the infinite sum already? 
 Update 
I've started off supposing there exists some solution, to the differential equation of the form
$$p(x)y''(x)+q(x)y'(x)+r(x)y(x)=0,$$ that can be written as 
$$y(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x-x_0)^n. $$
Since I already know this solution should be of the form $$y(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(3n)!}$$ I know that $a_n=\frac{1}{(3n)!}, x=1, x_0=0$. Furthermore, writing $$y'(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n\ a_n(x-x_0)^{n-1} \ \ and \ \ y''(x)=\sum_{n=2}^\infty n(n-1)\ a_n(x-x_0)^{n-2}. $$ and filling this in the differential equation I finally end up with the equation

"Check if $\mathbb{Z}_5/x^2 + 3x + 1$ is a field. Is $(x+2)$ a unit, if so calculate its inverse.  
 I would say that this quotient ring is not a field, because $<x^2 + 3x + 1>$ is not a maximal ideal, since $x^2 + 3x + 1 = (x+4)^2$ is not irreducible.   
 However, the result should still be a ring, right? How do I check if $(x+2)$ is a unit in that ring. Should I just ""try"" to invert it, or is there a better way.

"Since Ronaldo just came to play in Italy but didn't manage to score on his first 2 matches, I wanted to give an estimate of the probability that he scores tonight. 
In order to achieve this (in a quite naive way) I made some assumptions:
-The strength of opposing team has no influence on his odds of scoring.
-His odds of scoring at least one goal or more in a certain match remain constant in the season and is $p = \frac{20}{38}$ obtained by imagining that he probably will be able to score in 20 different matches (I don't care how many goals he scores, just if he scores or not). 
 We can now treat this distribution as a binomial where X = ""Ronaldo scores on certain match"" which is a Bernoulli varibale with $P(X) = \frac{20}{38}$. 
 My doubt now is: to calculate the odds of him scoring today in his 3rd match , given the fact that he didn't score in the first 2, should I use conditional probability given the fact that I know he didn't score in the first 2 matches or not? 
 In the beginning I thought of calculating the odds he would score tonight as (having $X_3$ the binomial variable Bin( 3 matches , $p = \frac{20}{38}$) ):
Probability($X_3 = 0$ ).
But then I thought that I might have to calculate it using conditional prob:

 We can write
 \begin{align}
\Pr(\tau<\infty)&=1-\Pr(\mathcal E(B)_n>\frac 12\text{ for all }n).

But then how to proceed. I have no idea why we are trying to compute  $\mathcal E(B)_n$  and neither do I know how to compute this probability. Can someone give me a hint? Thank you! 
 
 Edit: 
 I have a rough idea but it still does not work. We need to involve  $\Pr(\tau<\infty)$ . 
 Firstly, it is easy to show that  $\mathcal E(B)_n,\mathcal E(W)_n$  are martingales. Secondly, it is easy to see that  $\tau,\sigma$  are stopping times with respect to the filtration  $\mathcal \{F_n\}_{n\in\mathbb Z_{>0}} $  . So I want to use the Optimal Stopping Theorem. Note that
 \begin{align}
\mathbb E[\mathcal E(B)_\tau]&=\mathbb E[\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathcal E(B)_{n\wedge\tau}].
\end{align} 
By Fatou's lemma,  $$\mathbb E[\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathcal E(B)_{n\wedge\tau}]\le\liminf_{n\to\infty}\mathbb E[\mathcal E(B)_{n\wedge\tau}].$$ 
Since  $\mathcal E(B)_n$  is a martingale, we have
 $$ \mathbb E[\mathcal E(B)_{n\wedge\tau}]=\mathbb E[\mathcal E(B)_{0\wedge\tau}]=1. $$ 
 So  $1\ge \mathbb E[\mathcal E(B)_\tau].$ 
 Write  $\mathbb E[\mathcal E(B)_\tau]=\mathbb E[\mathcal E(B)_\tau 1_{\tau<\infty}+\mathcal E(B)_\tau 1_{\tau=\infty}]=\mathbb E[\mathcal E(B)_\tau;\tau<\infty]+\mathbb E[\mathcal E(B)_\tau;\tau=\infty].$ 
 
 Remark: Note that we have applied Fatou's lemma, but we cannot apply the dominated convergence to get equality, since the random walk can visit any big number before it returns to some point such that  $\mathcal E(B)_n\le\frac 12$ .

 It seems to me like the rational decision would be to play the game, because you expect to end up with more money. And then after your first coin toss, the same reasoning should apply for the decision about whether to play a second time, and so on... So then it seems like you should play as many times as possible and that your amount of money should approach infinity as  N  does. However when I simulate this in Python I am finding that the final amount of money always tends toward zero with enough flips.

 This one using  j  and  k  is confused, which make I think  ezk  is the previous layer output, and  ezj  is current new output. There is many equations contain such writing, some time j and k is diferent , just say both j and k are K-dimensional is not enough. 
 And ,In my opinion: 
 For example: if input  X=  [1,2,3,4,1,2,3] , assign each element as  Xi (i from 0 to X length 6) . Why not just calculate   Xi / SUM(X1 +.... X6)  for each element ?  e  seems meanless here, which also a factor make me think  ezk  and  ezj  are different.

"This is a problem from Bressoud ""Second Year Calculus"" Exercise 19 Section 2.5. It gives the conditions  $\vec{r}\cdot\vec{s}=0$ , and  $\vec{r}\cdot\vec{x}=c$ , and  $\vec{r}\times\vec{x}=\vec{s}$ . Find  $x$  in each of the three mutually orthogonal directions,  $\vec{r}$ ,  $\vec{s}$ , and  $\vec{r}\times\vec{s}$ . 
 So far  $\vec{x_r}=\frac{\vec{x}\cdot\vec{r}}{|r|}\frac{\vec{r}}{|r|}=\frac{c}{|r|^2}\vec{r}$ , and  $\vec{x_s}=\frac{\vec{x}\cdot\vec{s}}{|s|}\frac{\vec{s}}{|s|}=\frac{\vec{x}\cdot(\vec{r}\times\vec{x})}{|s|}\frac{\vec{s}}{|s|}=0$  Since  $\vec{x}\cdot(\vec{r}\times\vec{x})$  is the volumn of a degenerate parallelepiped. Where I'm having most difficulty is in... 
 $\vec{x_{\vec{r}\times\vec{s}}}=\frac{\vec{x}\cdot(\vec{r}\times\vec{s})}{|\vec{r}\times\vec{s}|^2}\vec{r}\times\vec{s}$ .

"In my textbook of science (class 10), it is given that for any mirror, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. 
 Here I m talking about spherical mirror. A convex mirror. 
 All rays which are incident on a mirror meet at a point called focus. And it is also given that focus is the midpoint of radius of the sphere. 
 The below is the diagram given in the book. It shows that if the object is at a known distance from the convex mirror, it will form this type of image. It shows that if a light ray is incident parallel to the principal axis, it will passes through focus.
 
 I tried to calculate this:-

 $$PF = FC = x$$ 
 $$\angle{FDC} = \angle{GDH} = \alpha \text{(Vertically Opposite Angles)}$$

 $$\angle{PDF} = \angle{DPF}$$

 $$\angle{DPF} = \angle{PDC}$$ 
This means  $\angle{FDC} = 0$  and F = C. But it is given that  $2PF = PC.$

$$\int_{x_1+\ldots+x_n \geq a} \exp\left[ -\pi \left(x_1^2+\ldots+x_n^2 \right)\right]
dx_1\cdots dx_n, $$
as a function of $a$, in possibly the shortest and the easiest way. I need such result in a paper in mathematical psychology and I would like to avoid writing a dedicated appendix. 
 I know how to find the solution. However, I believe there is a simpler solution (eg. a clever change of variables, or a trick with differentiation). Do you know one? 
 My solution : 
 Let 
 $$I(n,a,b) = \int_{x_1+\ldots+x_n \geq a} \exp\left[ -\pi \left(b x_1^2+\ldots+x_n^2 \right)\right]
dx_1\cdots dx_n$$
After change of variables $t = x_1+\ldots+x_n$ we obtain
$$I(n,a,b) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\cdots \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{a}^{\infty}  \exp\left[ -\pi \left(b (t-x_2-\ldots-x_n)^2+\ldots+x_n^2 \right)\right]
dt dx_2\cdots dx_n.$$
After integrating out $x_n$ we arrive at
$$I(n,a,b)=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{1+b}}I(n-1,a,\tfrac{b}{1+b}).$$
Then
$$I(n,a,1) = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} I(n-1,a,\tfrac{1}{2}) = \ldots
= \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{k}} I(n-k+1,a,\tfrac{1}{k}) = \ldots =
\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{n}} I(1,a,\tfrac{1}{n}).$$
Consequently, we get the solution
$$I(n,a,1) = \int_{a}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \exp \left[ -\pi \frac{1}{n} t^2\right]dt
= \int_{a/\sqrt{n}}^\infty \exp \left[ -\pi t^2\right]dt,$$
which is related to the error function (Erf).

"By  this paper , it can be shown that for $n>0$ and $N\in\mathbb{N}$
$$\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{Nn}{Nk}=\frac{2^{Nn}}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(-1)^{kn}\cos^{Nn}\left(\frac{k\pi}{N}\right)$$ 
 Now, for a recursive sequence defined here,
$$A_n(N)=-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{Nn}{Nk}A_k(N); A_0(N)=1$$ 
 and so 
 $$A_n(N)+1=-\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\binom{Nn}{Nk}A_k(N)$$ 
 From here it can be easily obtained that $A_1(N)=-1$.  Now I originally wanted to show that for certain values, we have that  
 $$A_n(N)+1\equiv 0\pmod{N+1}$$ 
 But this seems to be only true for certain values of $N$, where $N=2,3,4,6$.  I determined this by an induction argument, whose base case is above.  For all $0<k<m$, we assume $A_m(N)+1\equiv 0\pmod{N+1}$.  This means that $A_m(N)\equiv N\equiv -1\pmod{N+1}$ and thus $A_m(N)=(N+1)q-1$ for $q\in\mathbb{Z}$.  Substituting into the above recursion yields 
 $$A_m(N)+1=-\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}\binom{Nm}{Nk}[(N+1)q-1]=-(N+1)\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}\binom{Nm}{Nk}q+\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}\binom{Nm}{Nk}$$ 
 The first RHS sum is necessarily divisible by $N+1$, so the second sum in question would have to be divisible by $N+1$.  However this is not always the case.  To see its divisibility by $2,3,4$ and $6$, note that  
 \begin{eqnarray*}\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}\binom{Nm}{Nk}&=&\sum_{k=0}^{m}\binom{Nm}{Nk}-\binom{Nm}{0}-\binom{Nm}{Nm}\\&=&\frac{2^{Nm}}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(-1)^{km}\cos^{Nm}\left(\frac{k\pi}{N}\right)-2\end{eqnarray*} 
 And from this form, we can show the validity of divisibilities for $N=2,3,4,6$ by cases (replacing $N$ and working out the residue under modulus $(N+1)$) 
 My question is this.  I KNOW that it is not true for all $N$ through a proof presented  here .  Is there a way to either 
 1)  Find more values of $N$ where it holds 
 2)  if not, prove that for the remaining values of $N$, the hypothesis is wrong?  
 The values of $N$ chosen $(2,3,4,6)$ are based due to the fact the formula above involves cosines and take on simple values to calculate algebraically.  I don't know how to show that it is invalid for the remaining or how to find other values of $N$.  Can anyone help guide the way? 
 EDIT: So I used Mathematica to do a calculation of the divisibility up to $N=50$.    Using the binomial sum instead of the cosine sum, I was able to see that for the first 50 numbers of each recursion for $N$, the values of $N$ that seem to produce the divisibility results are those numbers that are prime powers minus 1, $p^\alpha$, for prime $p$ and positive integer $\alpha$.

"I was working today on approximating  $x!$  using the integral of  $\ln x$ , and using computer software to calculate limits, I found that  $\dfrac{(12x)(\sqrt{2\pi x})(x^x)}{(12x-1)e^x}$  gives a very close approximation of  $x!$ . Multiplying the figure by  $\dfrac{288x^2}{288x^2+1}$  seems to render the approximation even closer, and there are obviously further terms one could add as well. What I'm curious about is the role of the  $\sqrt{2\pi x}$  term; I knew there would be a (hopefully asymptotic) error term in the product, but  $\sqrt{2\pi}$  had never crossed my mind as a possibility. Is there an intuitive reason that this term appears here?

 Calculate the trajectory  integral  $$I=\int_{\gamma}zdl$$  where  $\gamma$  is a curve obtained by the intersection  of the surfaces given by the equations  $x^2+y^2=z^2,y^2=ax$  from the point  $(0,0,0)$  to  $(a,a,\sqrt{2}a)$ 
 
 ** My attempt ** 
 We need to parametrize the expression, note that the parametrization of  $\gamma$  is given by  $x=t$ , $y=\sqrt{at}$ , $z=\sqrt{t^2+at}$  where  $t\in [0,a]$ . 
 Now we find the derivatives of our parametrization  $x^{\prime}=1$ , $y^{\prime}=\frac{a}{2\sqrt{at}}$ , $z^{\prime}=\frac{2t+a}{2 \sqrt{t^2+at}}$ 
 now note that our parametrization is  $C:[0,a]\rightarrow(t,\sqrt{at},\sqrt{t^2+at})$  where  $C$  is injective trajectory, now we find
 $||C^{\prime}(t)||=\sqrt{(x^{\prime})^2+(y^{\prime})^2+(z^{\prime})^2}$  and
 $||C^{\prime}(t)||=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{8t^2+9at+2a^2}{t^2+at}}$  now we substitute it in  $I$  like a
 $$I=\int_{\gamma}zdl=\frac{1}{2}*\int_{0}^{a}\sqrt{t^2+at}\sqrt{\frac{8t^2+9at+2a^2}{t^2+at}}dt=\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{a} \sqrt{8t^2+9at+2a^2}dt$$ 
Finally solving the latest integral we get
 $$I=\int_{\gamma}zdl=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{256}a\left(-72 \sqrt{2} \sqrt{a^2}+200 \sqrt{19} \sqrt{a^2}+17 \sqrt{2} a \log \left(8 \sqrt{a^2}+9 a\right)-17 \sqrt{2} a \log \left(4 \sqrt{38} \sqrt{a^2}+25 a\right)\right)$$ 
And like the intersection is two lines we multiply it by  $2$  and we get
 $$I=\int_{\gamma}zdl=(\frac{1}{256}a\left(-72 \sqrt{2} \sqrt{a^2}+200 \sqrt{19} \sqrt{a^2}+17 \sqrt{2} a \log \left(8 \sqrt{a^2}+9 a\right)-17 \sqrt{2} a \log \left(4 \sqrt{38} \sqrt{a^2}+25 a\right)\right)$$ 
Is my approach fine?  or probably I forget some detail. 
 I think that it wrong because usually when I apply a parametrization the integrand is much easy than it, and i had to compute the Integral in Wolphram Mathematica , because it is so much large.
Please any help, hit or comment are useful and appreciate .

"I'm trying to solve the problem in the image but having trouble formulating the problem mathematically: 
 
 There are  $20$  identical laptops on a trolley, out of which  $12$  have
a hard disk with capacity  $160$  GB and  $8$  with a capacity of  $320$ 
GB. A teacher randomly takes two laptops from the trolley. A student
then takes a laptop from the trolley to complete a project. Given that
the student took a laptop with  $160$  GB, find the probability that the
teacher took both laptops with  $320$  GB. 
 
 so any help will be appreciated. 
 I've tried the following: let  $A$  denote the event of choosing a 160GB laptop, and  $B$  denote the event of choosing a 320GB laptop. Then  $P(A)= 12/20, P(B)=8/20.$  Next, let  $C$  denote the event of choosing 2 laptops, regardless of their memory (160GB or 320GB). Then  $P(C)=2/20$  (right?) Then  $B \cap C$  will denote the event of choosing two 320GB laptops (right?). But then how do I calculate  $P(B \cap C)?$ 
 Also, how do I calculate the probability of  $D:=$   choosing two 160GB laptops and  $P(A|D)$ ? I understand that at the end we'll need to calculate  $P(D|A)$ , and hence we'll need to use the formula  $P(D|A)= \frac{P(D \cap A)}{P(A)}= 20/12 * P(D \cap A)=20/12 * P(A|D) P(D).$  Here's where I'm confused: how to I calculate  $ P(A|D), P(D)?$

"Suppose we have the following definite integral: 
 $$\int^a_b f(x)g'(x)dx$$ 
 I know I can solve it using the  by parts  formula to obtain a primitive to then evaluate it in  $a$  and subtract the evaluation of the same primitive in  $b$ . 
 I was wondering if the integral can also be solved using the  by parts  formula, calculate a primitive of the  second  integral (the one obtained applying the by parts formula) and calculating first the second integral in the  $[a,b]$  interval and then recalculating the original integral, also in the  $[a,b]$  interval of course.
In formulas: 
 $$\int^a_b f(x)g'(x)dx = f(x)g(x) - \int^a_b f'(x)g(x)dx$$ 
 Then, calling the second integral  $y(x) = \int^a_b f'(x)g(x)dx$  and being  $Y(x)$  a primitive of the second integral, I wonder if is it ok to write: 
 $$ \int^a_b f(x)g'(x)dx = f(x)g(x) - \int^a_b f'(x)g(x)dx = [f(x)g(x) -  [Y(x)]^a_b]^a_b = [f(x)g(x) - (Y(a)-Y(b))]^a_b$$ 
 We can then state  $Y(a)-Y(b) = k$ 
 $$[f(x)g(x) - (Y(a)-Y(b))]^a_b = [f(x)g(x) - k]^a_b = f(a)g(a)-k - (f(b)g(b)-k) = f(a)g(a)-f(b)g(b)$$

"This question is related to a programming question. Because I think it's pure mathematic I post this question here. 
 I want to calculate the difference in days to a reference point. Therefore I have two inputs: 
 
 indexPath.Item : natural number between zero and infinite 
 ordinality : natural number between zero and six, which represents a
day in a week 
 
 
 ordinality: 
 0 - Sunday 
  1 - Monday 
  2 - Tuesday 
  3 - Wednesday 
  4 - Thursday 
  5 - Friday 
  6 - Saturday 
 
 I made a sketch to demonstrate my task: 
 
 As you can see I have a reference date - the 1st of Feb. 2015. This day is a Sunday and the ordinality for Sunday is 0. I want to calculate the difference in days to this date in dependency of the  ordinality  and the  indexPath.Item . 
 I can't figure out how a equation would look like under these conditions. I could set up an input/output table as follows: 
 
 x = indexPath.Item 
  y = ordinality 
  z = difference in days   
 y=0 x=10 z=4 
  y=0 x=9 z=3 
  y=0 x=8 z=2 
  y=0 x=7 z=1 
  y=0 x=6 z=0 
  y=0 x=5 z=-1 
  y=0 x=4 z=-2 
  y=0 x=3 z=-3 
  y=0 x=2 z=-4 
  y=0 x=1 z=-5 
  y=0 x=0 z=-6 
 
 This is only an example, where y is always zero. 
 The reference date in my case is always the first of a month. The 1st of a month falls into a week - namely the first week of a month (the 1st week of a month doesn't always include a full week in my case!). The 1st of a month defines the ordinality (y) and this is the start (or the shift if you want) of my calculations. Here the difference in days is zero. If y = 0, Sunday (last column) is the start. If y = 6, Saturday (next-to-last column) is the start. In x direction the difference in days increases and in -x direction the difference in days decreases (negative values). 
 Can anyone give me a hint in the right direction? 
 Edit: 
 I found out that  1 - y + x  would work, but here another ordinality (y) is used: Monday: 1 - Sunday: 7. So this formula doesn't work for y = 0. Can this be expressed in an adapted formula?

"I am extremely new a calculating big O notation and I am extremely confused by this quote from the book  Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications 
 
For instance, if we have two algorithms for solving a problem, one using 100n^2 + 17n + 4 operations and the other using n^3 operations, big-O notation can help us see that the first algorithm uses far fewer operations when n is large, even though it uses more operations for small values of n, such as n = 10.
 
 So if n is less than 10 (E.G. 5), are we just going to substitute it like: 
 100*5^2 + 17*5 + 4 
 But this is larger than 5*3.

 For the first question, I am not sure of an easy way to calculate this other than to enumerate all possibilities. Is there a simpler solution? 
 For the second question, my answer was  $\frac{6\cdot{4 \choose 1}^7}{52 \choose 7}$ , since out of all possible combinations, for any straight, we can choose any of the 4 suited cards, and there are 6 possible straights (beginning with A, 1, 2 ... or 6).
